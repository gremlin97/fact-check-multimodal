Influenza  vaccination  is  the  primary 1 method for preventing influenza-related illnesses,   although  the  vaccine  effectiveness  ranges 2 from 20% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically  mismatched  to  the  circulating  viral strain to 40 to 60% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically well matched. 2,3 This large variation in effectiveness between years suggests that more effective vaccines are needed.\n\nIn traditional quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated  influenza  vaccines  (SD-IIV4),  chicken eggs  are  used  to  manufacture  the  influenza virus. Mutations in the hemagglutinin protein during egg-based manufacturing can result in mismatch between the selected strain and the vaccine strain.  The Flublok Quadrivalent influ4 enza  vaccine  (RIV4,  Sanofi)  is  manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical  to  that  in  the  selected  strain.   The  vaccine 5 also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin  protein  as  standard-dose  vaccines,  an increased  level  that  has  been  correlated  with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. 6\n\nTo  estimate  the  relative  effectiveness  of  the recombinant vaccine as compared with standarddose  vaccines  against  laboratory-confirmed  influenza and influenza-related outcomes, we compared the two formulations of vaccines among members  of  the  Kaiser  Permanente  Northern California (KPNC) health care system who were between 18 and 64 years of age during the two influenza seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020."

Additionally, while some evidence points to potential advantages of the recombinant HA in Flublok (Evidence 16),  more research may be needed to definitively establish superior effectiveness against influenza-related outcomes across all age groups.\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\n\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence only provides a section heading, offering no information related to the claim.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This describes the mechanism of action of Flublok and mentions HA proteins as antigens inducing an immune response.

Describes the mechanism of action but not the 3x HA content or comparison to standard-dose vaccines.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This explicitly states Flublok contains 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose.  This is crucial information for the first part of the claim.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Explicitly states quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Shows higher post-vaccination antibody titers in FluBlok recipients compared to placebo, supporting the increased immunogenicity aspect of the claim.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses pregnancy outcomes and adverse events, irrelevant to the claim.\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Mentions the study evaluated immunogenicity and safety, which is broadly related to the claim but doesn't provide specific details about HA content or comparison to other vaccines.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Same as Evidence 6.  Reinforces the 3x HA content.\n\nEvidence 11:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Same as Evidence 7. Provides further data supporting the increased immunogenicity of Flublok compared to placebo.\n\nEvidence 12:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Discusses efficacy against influenza illness, which is related to immunogenicity, but doesn't directly compare to standard-dose vaccines or address the 3x HA content.

Introduction\n\nDespite the availability of an array of influenza vaccines and recommendations for vaccination of individuals age 6 months\n\nand over, influenza remains a major cause of morbidity, hospitalizations and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Over the last 1-2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose influenza vaccine has been modest [1-5]. New influenza vaccine formulations, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vaccines, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years, including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addition, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recombinant technologies have been licensed that avoid the glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation [6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) strains."

          "text": "Despite the availability of an array of influenza vaccines and recommendations for vaccination of individuals age 6 months\n\nand over, influenza remains a major cause of morbidity, hospitalizations and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Over the last 1-2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose influenza vaccine has been modest [1-5]. New influenza vaccine formulations, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vaccines, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years, including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addition, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recombinant technologies have been licensed that avoid the glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation [6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) strains.\n\nReasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend upon having access to a sufficient number of recipients of any given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 % against laboratory-confirmed influenza [7] and 27 % against influenza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown significant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries ( /C21 65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell-cultured quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza-related hospital encounters [10]. However, the study was limited by the fact that there were no laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes. Thus, the full benefit of cell-culture vaccine technology is still largely unknown."

Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Influenza  vaccination  is  the  primary 1 method for preventing influenza-related illnesses,   although  the  vaccine  effectiveness  ranges 2 from 20% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically  mismatched  to  the  circulating  viral strain to 40 to 60% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically well matched. 2,3 This large variation in effectiveness between years suggests that more effective vaccines are needed.\n\nIn traditional quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated  influenza  vaccines  (SD-IIV4),  chicken eggs  are  used  to  manufacture  the  influenza virus. Mutations in the hemagglutinin protein during egg-based manufacturing can result in mismatch between the selected strain and the vaccine strain.  The Flublok Quadrivalent influ4 enza  vaccine  (RIV4,  Sanofi)  is  manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical  to  that  in  the  selected  strain.   The  vaccine 5 also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin  protein  as  standard-dose  vaccines,  an increased  level  that  has  been  correlated  with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. 6\n\nTo  estimate  the  relative  effectiveness  of  the recombinant vaccine as compared with standarddose  vaccines  against  laboratory-confirmed  influenza and influenza-related outcomes, we compared the two formulations of vaccines among members  of  the  Kaiser  Permanente  Northern California (KPNC) health care system who were between 18 and 64 years of age during the two influenza seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020."

          "text": "As is  the  case  for  all  vaccines,  influenza  vaccines  contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications  to  their  use  a  history  of  previous  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, although rare,  can  occur  after  influenza  vaccination,  even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, identifying the causative component without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be  difficult.  Severe  allergic  reactions  after  vaccination  with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition  to  development of allergic  manifestations  in affected persons ( 92-94 ). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions  can  occur,  ACIP  recommends  the  following  for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3):\n\n- •  For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4:\n- 0 A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each individual  egg-based  IIV4  and  LAIV4  is  also contraindicated  for  persons  who  have  had  a  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of  that  vaccine  (excluding  egg)  (see  Persons  with  a History of Egg Allergy).\n- •  For ccIIV4:\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in  such  instances,  vaccination  should  occur  in  an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised  by  a  health  care  provider  who  is  able  to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction.\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4.\n- •  For RIV4:\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of RIV4.

Several pieces of evidence directly support the claim that these mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness, citing examples of specific mutations and their impact on antibody binding and overall vaccine effectiveness. The evidence also discusses cell-based and recombinant vaccines as alternatives that avoid egg-adaptation issues. While the claim mentions both cell- and egg-based vaccines, the provided evidence predominantly addresses egg-based vaccines.  Some evidence is irrelevant to the claim, focusing on vaccine types, administration, or general influenza information.",

Several pieces of evidence directly support the claim that these mutations can reduce vaccine effectiveness, citing examples of specific mutations and their impact on antibody binding and overall vaccine effectiveness. The evidence also discusses cell-based and recombinant vaccines as alternatives that avoid egg-adaptation issues. While the claim mentions both cell- and egg-based vaccines, the provided evidence predominantly addresses egg-based vaccines.  Some evidence is irrelevant to the claim, focusing on vaccine types, administration, or general influenza information.\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This paragraph explicitly describes how egg-adaptation of a H3N2 strain led to the absence of a key glycosylation site, resulting in poor antibody neutralization.  It also contrasts this with recombinant HA vaccines which avoid such adaptations and induce optimal antibody levels.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This table provides specific examples of egg-adapted amino acid substitutions in egg-based vaccines, directly demonstrating the potential for mutations during production.\n\nEvidence 3:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This paragraph analyzes the HA sequences of different vaccine types and highlights specific egg-adapted substitutions in egg-based vaccines.  It further connects these changes with a loss of glycosylation motifs, supporting the claim.\n\nEvidence 4:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This section details the risk of adaptive mutations in egg-based vaccines and provides specific examples of how these mutations, particularly in the HA protein, can reduce vaccine effectiveness.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: While it discusses egg-adapted epitopes and reduced immunogenicity from repeat egg-based vaccinations, the focus is on the comparison of egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant vaccines. It does imply egg-adaptation is an issue, but doesn't detail the *development* of mutations during production.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 4.  Reinforces the risk of adaptive mutations and their impact on vaccine effectiveness.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Similar to Evidence 5, it mentions egg-adapted mutations and their potential to reduce vaccine effectiveness, but the primary focus is on comparing different vaccine platforms.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This section lists authors and the abstract, containing no information relevant to the claim about mutations in vaccine production.\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning:  This evidence emphasizes how recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of egg-adapted mutations by cloning HA DNA from a reference virus, thus eliminating the risk of antigenic mismatch.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This section discusses the focus of the review and doesn't address the claim about mutations during vaccine production.\n\nEvidence 11:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This table lists influenza vaccines and their presentations, which isn't relevant to mutations during production.\n\nEvidence 12:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Table title only, no relevant information.\n\nEvidence 13:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Mentions the modest effectiveness of egg-based vaccines and how egg-free vaccines avoid glycosylation issues associated with egg adaptation which can reduce effectiveness. However, doesn't detail the mutation *process*.\n\nEvidence 14:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This is a list of references, not actual evidence.\n\nEvidence 15:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses allergic reactions and contraindications related to different vaccine types, not mutations during production.\n\nEvidence 16:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This table lists influenza vaccine types and information unrelated to the development of mutations during production.\n\nEvidence 17:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Duplicate of Evidence 11, listing vaccine types and presentations, not relevant to mutations.\n\nEvidence 18:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses testing for carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of a specific vaccine, but not the development of mutations during standard production.\n\nEvidence 19:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Simply states \"Abstract\" and \"Background\", providing no information.\n\nEvidence 20:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Similar to Evidence 13, discusses the modest effectiveness of egg-based vaccines and the introduction of egg-free alternatives to avoid glycosylation issues associated with egg-adaptation.\n\nEvidence 21:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Clearly outlines the drawbacks of egg-based vaccine production, including the necessity of adapting viruses for egg growth, which can lead to receptor variants not representative of circulating strains.\n\nEvidence 22:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Duplicate of the end of Evidence 14, still just a list of references.\n\nEvidence 23:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Provides conclusions of a study on vaccine efficacy but doesn't directly address the claim about mutations during production.\n\nEvidence 24:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Another reference list.\n\nEvidence 25:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Section heading regarding nonclinical toxicology; not relevant to mutations during production.\n\nEvidence 26:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Study abstract and keywords.  While the study relates to vaccine production, this section provides no information relevant to the claim.\n\nEvidence 27:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Yet another reference list.\n\nEvidence 28:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Discusses the potential for egg-based vaccine mutations and the advantages of recombinant vaccines, but primarily focuses on relative effectiveness and not the mutation process itself.\n\nEvidence 29:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Duplicate section of the vaccine information table.  No relevance to mutations.\n\nEvidence 30:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses allergic reactions and contraindications related to different vaccine types. While it mentions prior reactions, it's not directly related to the *development* of mutations during production."

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The  effectiveness  of standard-dose vaccines - especially against the influenza A H3N2 subtype - may be attenuated by antigenic drift during egg-based manufacturing,  whereas  the  recombinant  vaccine  is  not susceptible to such drift. However, data from the California Department of Public Health showed that the H3N2 strain circulated only during the second half of the 2018-2019 season, 18 and even then, the circulating strain had drifted such that it was poorly matched to both the recombinant vaccine and the standard-dose vaccines. 19,20 During our study period, the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine as compared with a standard-dose vaccine seems less likely due to higher relative vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 than to higher effectiveness against influenza A overall associated with its higher dose of hemagglutinin antigen.\n\nA strength of our study is that the two study vaccine formulations were alternated in weekly intervals of time at each facility, which allowed us to balance covariates of interest as designed. In every KPNC geographic area, when influenza arrived, there were already participants who had received one of the two formulations of vaccine and  who  were  similar  with  respect  to  demographic  characteristics,  coexisting  illnesses, health care-seeking behavior, and the number of  weeks since vaccination. To our knowledge, this design has not been previously used, and its handling of potential confounding bias has not been formally studied. Our intent was to minimize imbalances between the participants who received each vaccine, both within and between facilities.  We  also  included  several  sensitivity analyses to address potential biases from clustering according to facility. Sensitivity analyses that  were  stratified  either  according  to  facility (to  compare  within  facilities)  or  according  to week (to compare between facilities) showed a relative  vaccine  effectiveness  of  approximately 15%,  similar  to  the  findings  of  our  primary analysis."

          "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nAlthough embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018 -19 ( N =723) and 2019 -20 ( N =684) in /uniFB02 uenza seasons.

In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.

RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2.

Several pieces of evidence strongly support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.  This is attributed to factors like the preservation of the native HA conformation (due to the absence of chemical modifications during production), specific glycosylation patterns in insect cells, and increased accessibility of the conserved stem region of rHA. Some evidence focuses on comparing RIVs to traditional egg-based vaccines, demonstrating superior performance in certain cases. However, some evidence is less relevant, dealing with study design or general information about influenza vaccines.

        "raw_explanation": "[General Analysis]\n\nThe retrieved evidence primarily focuses on the production process, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of recombinant influenza vaccines (RIVs), particularly Flublok/RIV4.  Several pieces of evidence strongly support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.  This is attributed to factors like the preservation of the native HA conformation (due to the absence of chemical modifications during production), specific glycosylation patterns in insect cells, and increased accessibility of the conserved stem region of rHA. Some evidence focuses on comparing RIVs to traditional egg-based vaccines, demonstrating superior performance in certain cases. However, some evidence is less relevant, dealing with study design or general information about influenza vaccines.  Crucially, while several studies suggest cross-protection,  the degree and consistency of this cross-protection are not fully established across all studies and influenza seasons.\n\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\n\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This excerpt directly addresses the claim by highlighting the cross-protective responses generated by baculovirus-expressed rHA against both circulating and drifted A/H3N2 strains. It explains the mechanism for this cross-protection, focusing on the glycosylation patterns and accessibility of the conserved stem region.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: While not directly addressing cross-protection, this evidence explains how the lack of chemical modifications in recombinant HA production preserves the native HA conformation, which is implied to be beneficial for an optimal immune response, potentially contributing to broader protection.\n\nEvidence 3:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This is essentially a duplicate of Evidence 1, therefore equally relevant and supportive of the claim for the same reasons.\n\nEvidence 4:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This describes the RIV4 production process and mentions its approval and clinical assessment.  While this context is helpful, it doesn't directly address cross-protection or breadth of immune response.  It lays the groundwork by introducing the recombinant vaccine being discussed.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This evidence supports the claim by demonstrating RIV4's ability to induce broadly cross-reactive antibody responses, especially in older adults, and highlights its association with seroconversion to a drifted H3N2 strain.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This excerpt details the statistical analysis methods of a study comparing recombinant and standard-dose vaccines. It does not provide any information on the breadth of immune response or cross-protection.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This excerpt describes the statistical power calculations and analysis methods of a study. It's related to comparing vaccine effectiveness but not directly to the claim about broader immune response or cross-protection.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This is a duplicate of Evidence 7 and is equally irrelevant to the claim.\n\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This excerpt summarizes a study demonstrating the efficacy of the trivalent rHA0 vaccine (FluBlok) in preventing culture-confirmed influenza despite antigenic mismatch, thus supporting the claim of cross-protection.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This fragment just mentions influenza vaccines and viruses used in a study; it provides no relevant information for evaluating the claim.\n\nEvidence 11:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning:  This excerpt discusses the potential reasons for the observed benefit of the recombinant vaccine, suggesting it might be related to the higher dose of hemagglutinin rather than specifically cross-protection against H3N2.

Offers supportive context but doesn't add novel information related to the specific claim.\n\nEvidence 20:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Largely duplicates information from Evidence 16 and 19, focusing on the study comparing vaccine platforms and the superior performance of RIV4 in inducing neutralizing antibodies, further strengthening the support for the claim.\n\nEvidence 21:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This section from the Flublok PI discusses how antibodies against one influenza strain don't necessarily protect against others, and how antigenic drift necessitates updating vaccine strains.

In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018 -19 ( N =723) and 2019 -20 ( N =684) in /uniFB02 uenza seasons. We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-eggbased vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immunememorytoegg-adaptedepitopesandre-focustheimmuneresponses towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.\n\nIn /uniFB02 uenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory infections in humans, annual in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination has been recommended in the United States (US) for many decades.

However, this manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating in /uniFB02 uenza strains 1 -6 . Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that donot rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including\n\na cell culture-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent ™ by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent® by Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 µ g HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µ g HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are currently licensed in the US . Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have 7 shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups 8 13 -.

Studies indicated that frequent prior vaccination could blunt the antibody responses to in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination over time 11,13,17 -21 which can lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness 22 26 -. One study reported that repeat vaccination reduced antibody af /uniFB01 nity maturation to the HA antigens of all vaccine components from egg-based, cell-culture based, and recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines 20 . Thus far, there are few direct comparisons of immunogenicity of the three vaccine platforms in populations with a history of frequent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccinations. We recently reported the comparison of immunogenicity of ccIIV and RIV to eggbased standard dose IIVs among US healthcare personnel (HCP) aged 18 -64 years from a randomized, open-label trial during the 2018 -2019 season 27 and the 2019 -2020 season following repeat vaccination in 2 consecutive years 28,29 . Those comparisons were focused on the neutralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses only. RIV4 elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses than IIV4 against cell-propagated vaccine viruses 27 . Repeat vaccination with ccIIV4 or RIV4 in 2 seasons also resulted in signi /uniFB01 cantly higher post-vaccination antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses 29 . Most HCP participants had received egg-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines frequently during the preceding /uniFB01 ve seasons."

In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018 -19 ( N =723) and 2019 -20 ( N =684) in /uniFB02 uenza seasons. We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-eggbased vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immunememorytoegg-adaptedepitopesandre-focustheimmuneresponses towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness."

Influenza  vaccination  is  the  primary 1 method for preventing influenza-related illnesses,   although  the  vaccine  effectiveness  ranges 2 from 20% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically  mismatched  to  the  circulating  viral strain to 40 to 60% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically well matched. 2,3 This large variation in effectiveness between years suggests that more effective vaccines are needed.\n\nIn traditional quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated  influenza  vaccines  (SD-IIV4),  chicken eggs  are  used  to  manufacture  the  influenza virus. Mutations in the hemagglutinin protein during egg-based manufacturing can result in mismatch between the selected strain and the vaccine strain.  The Flublok Quadrivalent influ4 enza  vaccine  (RIV4,  Sanofi)  is  manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical  to  that  in  the  selected  strain.   The  vaccine 5 also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin  protein  as  standard-dose  vaccines,  an increased  level  that  has  been  correlated  with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. 6\n\nTo  estimate  the  relative  effectiveness  of  the recombinant vaccine as compared with standarddose  vaccines  against  laboratory-confirmed  influenza and influenza-related outcomes, we compared the two formulations of vaccines among members  of  the  Kaiser  Permanente  Northern California (KPNC) health care system who were between 18 and 64 years of age during the two influenza seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020."

RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speci /uniFB01 c to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax ® [Trivalent]) 77 . Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to eggor mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (Flucelvax ® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone ® quadrivalent SD, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) 60 . These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12,81 .\n\nRIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al. 82 , participants aged 65 -74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion inactivated trivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Fluzone ® High Dose, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3) 82 . Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cellpropagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain ( p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and"

          "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nAlthough embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

CDC epidemio-″ logical data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while A/H1N1 and B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens."

During this study period, 1386 cases of PCR-confirmed influenza were diagnosed in the recombinant-vaccine group and 2435 cases in the standard-dose group. Among the participants who were 50 to 64 years of age, 559 participants (2.00  cases  per  1000)  tested  positive  for  influenza  in  the  recombinant-vaccine group as compared with 925 participants (2.34 cases per 1000) in the standarddose group (relative vaccine effectiveness, 15.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 23.8; P  =  0.002). In the same age group, the relative vaccine effectiveness against influenza A was 15.7% (95% CI, 6.0 to 24.5; P  =  0.002). The recombinant vaccine was  not  significantly  more  protective  against  influenza-related  hospitalization than were the standard-dose vaccines."

This study is an exploratory analysis. The detailed participant enrollment, randomization, and blinding were previously described 27 -29 .

During Year 1, HCP were strati /uniFB01 edbytwo age groups (18 -44 years and 45 -64 years) and randomized at 4:4:2:2 ratio to receive one of four quadrivalent vaccines: ccIIV4 (Flucelvax), RIV4 (Flublok), Fluzone IIV4 or Fluarix IIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0 pre-vaccination), 1-month, and 6-months post-vaccination. The Year 2 study was designed to evaluate the antibody responses following 7 different Year 1-Year 2 repeat vaccination regimens: IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0) and 1-month post-vaccination.\n\nFluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, the two egg-based vaccines were analyzed separately for this exploratory analysis because the two vaccines have different egg-adaptated mutation on the HA of the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV (Table 1). Fluzone has Q223R substitution which was associated with focused antibody response to 223R in some vaccinees as we previously reported 38 , while the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV in Fluarix had 223Q. In addition, the current analysis is also agestrati /uniFB01 ed by 18 -44 years and 45 -64 years age groups as we previously observed that the impact of vaccine egg-adaptation on antibody response to A(H3N2) virus may be age-related . 3"

Protective efficacy\n\nSubjects in this study were followed throughout the subsequent influenza season (mid December 2007 to end April 2008) with weekly phone calls and instructed to return to the study clinics for any acute respiratory illness, at which time a combined nasal andthroatswabforviralculturewasobtained.Theprimaryefficacy endpoint for this study was the development of culture-confirmed CDC-ILI, and we also assessed the effect of vaccination on rates of any influenza culture positive illness.\n\nA total of 582 subjects were cultured for respiratory illness, and influenza virus was isolated from 178 subjects. There were a total of 120 subjects from whom influenza A was isolated, the majority of whom (82/120, 68%) met the CDC-ILI case definition. There were a total of 59 subjects with positive cultures for influenza B, and the majority of these subjects (41/59, 69%) also met the CDC-ILI case definition.\n\nOnly 8 isolates in the study (&lt;5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in FluBlok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one FluBlok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of FluBlok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine.\n\nThe remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4-fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 42H3N2virusesthat could not be identified as either A/Wisconsinlike or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty-eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, representing a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized."

If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard-dose vaccines (60 µ g for HD-IIV4 and 45 µ g for RIV4, compared with 15 µ g for standard-dose inactivated vaccines).

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus."

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody).\n\nAntibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine."

        "raw_explanation": "[General Analysis]\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells with a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).  Multiple sources explicitly describe this production process.  While some evidence focuses on specific aspects like the resulting HA structure or comparing Flublok to egg-based vaccines, the core components of the claim are consistently confirmed.\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This section from the Flublok product insert (PI) directly describes the production process, mentioning the insect cell line, baculovirus vector, and purification steps.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This section heading from the PI only mentions \"Mechanism of Action,\" which is irrelevant to the production process.\n\nEvidence 3:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 1.  Same section of the Flublok PI confirming the production process.\n\nEvidence 4:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: From a clinical trial publication using Flublok, this explicitly states the vaccine consists of HA produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Just a section heading - no relevant information about the production platform.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This review article directly states that Flublok (RIV4) production is based on a \"novel production platform\" using rHA expressed in insect cells with a BEVS. It provides a brief overview of the process.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning:  This section discusses the unique features of the insect cell-derived rHA in Flublok, indirectly supporting the claim about its production platform.  The mention of regulatory designations (\"product exclusivity,\" \"new active substance,\" \"innovative drug\") reinforces the novelty of the approach.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This snippet from the PI mentions that Flublok and Flublok Quadrivalent are manufactured using the same process. While it doesn't detail the process itself, it links the two vaccines which strengthens the other evidence discussing Flublok's production.\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses the mechanism of action of the vaccine, not its production.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This introduction contrasts traditional egg-based influenza vaccine production with the advantages of baculovirus expression in insect cells, highlighting the latter as a promising technology. Although it doesn't explicitly mention Flublok, the context strongly supports the claim.\n\nEvidence 11:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 4.  Reinforces the claim with details about the HA protein produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system.\n\nEvidence 12:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Reinforces Evidence 7, emphasizing the advantages of the insect cell/BEVS platform in terms of speed and independence from egg-based methods.\n\nEvidence 13:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Discusses the need for alternative vaccine production platforms, setting the stage for the relevance of Flublok's novel approach. However, it only briefly mentions Flublok's use of recombinant protein strategies.\n\nEvidence 14:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: While discussing the structural features of the rHA, it indirectly supports the claim by highlighting details related to the insect cell production process, such as the uncleaved HA0 protein.\n\nEvidence 15:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Duplicate of Evidence 10. Reinforces the contrast between egg-based and insect cell/baculovirus approaches, indirectly supporting the claim.\n\nEvidence 16:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Focuses on antibody analysis methods, not the vaccine production process.\n\nEvidence 17:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Table showing vaccine virus information, irrelevant to the production platform."

When these are extracted from in /uniFB02 uenza viruses, they form clusters of varying sizes. This has been observed in conventional in /uniFB02 uenza virus-derived vaccines, with estimates of 18 to 1100 trimers per cluster 55,66,67 . Two distinct populations of cluster have been observed; the majority have an average diameter of 150 nm, while the remainder are larger (average diameter, 5500 nm) 66 . However, the rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniform in size and presentation, containing around six to eight HA trimers per cluster at an average diameter of approximately 30 -40 nm 55,67 . The elution of rHA from RIV4 drug substance as a single peak in sizeexclusion high-performance liquid chromatography is monitored for the release and the stability of RIV4.\n\nFurther characterisation by cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the HA rosette clusters in RIV4 are uniformly star /uniFB01 sh-shaped; whereas in the split vaccine they are mostly nonsymmetrical and agglomerated into huge structures, resulting in both star /uniFB01 shand peanut-shaped heterogeneous particles 55 . Additional electron microscopy analysis of split vaccine clusters showed a highly heterogeneous mixture containing different types of viral particles containing HA and NA as well as split viral membrane folded in various shapes, slightly disrupted virions, and whole virions 66 .\n\nIn Canada between 2000 and 2004, an unusual number of cases of a syndrome termed as oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS) were reported following immunisation with the inactivated in /uniFB02 uenza split-virus vaccine 68 . Detailed analysis revealed that ORS, induced within 2 to 24 h of vaccination, was suspected to be due to the presence of micro-aggregates of unsplit virions in the conventional egg-derived in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines 69 . High levels of aggregate content in the split vaccine are believed to have induced a Type-2 polarised immune response resulting in ORS based on study results from a mouse model 70 . Although extremely rare, this is unlikely to occur with RIV4 that contains HA rosettes of small and uniform size."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg (as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay) of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza viruses recommended for the 2007-2008 influenza season formulated with 0.005% Tween ® -20 in 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 ± 0.4 without a preservative. Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein. Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection, USP.\n\n## 2.2. Clinical study design"

FluBlok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in FluBlok than in placebo recipients ( P &lt;.001 for all comparisons). The proportion of FluBlok recipients with a post-vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5%), 97% for the H3 component (94.8%, 98.3%), and 96% for the B component (94.0%, 97.8%).\n\nAmong FluBlok recipients, subjects with a self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccine in the year prior to the study had higher baseline titers of antibody against all three components, and had significantly lower frequencies of HAI response than did those who reported that they had not received vaccine in the previous year. Subjects who reported prior vaccine receipt also had lower post vaccination GMTs for all three components than did those without this history, and this difference was statistically significant for both influenza A components.\n\n## 3.3.

The overall protective efficacy of FluBlok against culture positive CDC-ILI regardless of strain was 44.6% (95% CI 18.8%, 62.6%).

For the 2022-23 season,  U.S.-licensed  influenza  vaccines  will  contain hemagglutinin  (HA)  derived  from  an  influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for eggbased vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like  virus  (for  egg-based  vaccines)  or  an influenza A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture-based or recombinant vaccines); an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and  an  influenza  B/Phuket/3073/2013  (Yamagata lineage)-like virus.\n- 2.  Influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2022-23 season, their age indications, and their presentations are described (T able 1). Afluria Quadrivalent is not expected to be available in a 0.25-mL prefilled syringe presentation. When using Afluria Quadrivalent for children aged 6 through 35 months (who require a 0.25-mL dose), the dose must be obtained from a multidose vial. One labeling change is  described.  In  October  2021,  FDA  granted approval for the use of Flucelvax Quadrivalent (cell culturebased quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4]) for children aged 6 months through &lt;2 years. As of March 2021, Flucelvax Quadrivalent had been approved for persons aged ≥2 years. Approval for children aged 6 months through &lt;2 years was based on results of a randomized, observer-blind study that compared immunogenicity and safety of Flucelvax Quadrivalent with that of a licensed comparator IIV4 among 2,402 children aged 6 through 47 months, of whom 894 were aged 6 through 23 months. Flucelvax Quadrivalent is now approved for persons aged ≥6 months.\n- 3.  On the basis of review of evidence concerning high-dose inactivated  influenza  vaccine  (HD-IIV),  recombinant influenza  vaccine  (RIV),  and  MF59-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV), recommendations for  influenza  vaccination  of  persons  aged  ≥65  years\n\nhave  been  modified.  ACIP  recommends  that  adults aged  ≥65  years  preferentially  receive  any  one  of  the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent  high-dose  inactivated  influenza  vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4).

        "raw_explanation": "[General Analysis]\nThe evidence strongly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain and that standard-dose influenza vaccines contain 15 mcg of HA per strain.  Multiple sources (Flublok PI, CDC documents, and a research article) explicitly state these HA amounts.  The evidence also clarifies that Flublok is considered a \"high-dose\" vaccine due to this increased HA content.\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence only mentions the section title \"Clinical Pharmacology\" and doesn't provide information about HA content.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This excerpt from the Flublok Prescribing Information (PI) explicitly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA for each of the three influenza virus strains.\n\nEvidence 3:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This is a duplicate of Evidence 2 and provides the same information directly supporting the claim.\n\nEvidence 4:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This section of the Flublok PI discusses the mechanism of action involving HA proteins, but it doesn't mention the specific amount of HA per strain. It indirectly supports the claim by confirming the presence of HA proteins.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence discusses a study comparing Flublok Quadrivalent to another vaccine, which is not relevant to the claim about HA content in standard-dose vaccines.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This evidence from a 2011 study describes Flublok containing 45 mcg of each of the three purified rHA0 proteins.  While the strains are from a different season, the HA amount per strain is consistent with the claim.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence discusses antibody responses to the FluBlok vaccine but doesn't provide information comparing its HA content to standard-dose vaccines.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence discusses the efficacy of Flublok against different influenza strains, which is not relevant to the claim about HA content.\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This evidence explicitly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (like Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines, directly supporting the claim.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This is a duplicate of a portion of Evidence 8 and is therefore not relevant to the HA amounts.\n\nEvidence 11:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This is a duplicate of Evidence 7 and is therefore not relevant to the HA amounts.\n\n\nEvidence 12:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This is a duplicate of Evidence 9 and therefore supports the claim by stating recombinant vaccines contain three times the HA of standard dose vaccines.\n\nEvidence 13:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This evidence describes the study design of a comparison between recombinant and standard dose vaccines but doesn't explicitly state the HA amounts.\n\nEvidence 14:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This is a duplicate of Evidence 13.\n\nEvidence 15:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence presents the results of the study comparing Flublok Quadrivalent and standard-dose vaccines but doesn't confirm the specific HA amounts being compared.\n\nEvidence 16:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This table from the CDC lists Flublok Quadrivalent as containing 45 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose and other quadrivalent vaccines (standard dose) as containing 15 mcg/0.5 mL, directly supporting the claim.\n\nEvidence 17:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence mentions recommendations for influenza vaccines but does not discuss HA content.\n\n\nEvidence 18:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This is a title referring to a table of influenza vaccines and provides no relevant information on HA content.\n\n\nEvidence 19:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This table from the CDC shows several standard dose quadrivalent vaccines containing 15 mcg HA/0.5mL, which when taken with the other CDC evidence (16), helps support the claim of 15 mcg/strain for standard dose vaccines.\n\nEvidence 20:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This text explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) contains 45 mcg of HA per virus and standard dose vaccines contain 15 mcg, directly supporting the claim.\n\n\nEvidence 21:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning:  This is a partial duplicate of Evidence 19 and therefore partially supports the claim.\n\nEvidence 22:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This discusses the composition of the 2022-2023 flu vaccines, but not the amounts of HA.\n\nEvidence 23:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This is a partial duplicate of Evidence 16 and continues to directly support the claim.\n\n\nEvidence 24:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: This is a duplicate of the table shown in Evidence 16 and some other snippets, therefore supports the claim with the same reasoning."
