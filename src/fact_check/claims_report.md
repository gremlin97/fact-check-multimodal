# Claims Verification Results

## Claim 1

**Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.**

### Analysis

The claim asks whether Flublok *ensures* an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. Evidence 1 and 2 are irrelevant, dealing with nonclinical toxicology studies.  Evidence 3 and 4 (which are practically identical) from the Treanor et al. (2011) study *directly contradict* the claim. The study found that less than 5% of circulating flu strains were antigenically identical to the vaccine strains included in Flublok during the study period. This clearly demonstrates that Flublok does not *ensure* an identical match.  While Flublok offered some protection against various flu strains, it wasn't due to a perfect antigenic match with the prevalent circulating strains.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence discusses carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and fertility studies, which are irrelevant to the claim about antigenic match.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Same as Evidence 1.  This is the same text repeated.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Disagrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence directly addresses the claim by examining the antigenic match of Flublok with circulating strains in a real-world setting. The study found very few isolates were antigenically identical to the vaccine strains, explicitly stating that a meaningful estimate of efficacy against strains represented in the vaccine could not be obtained.  This refutes the idea that Flublok *ensures* identical antigenic matches.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Disagrees
- **Reasoning**: This is a duplicate of Evidence 3 and provides the same refutation of the claim.

Subjects in this study were followed throughout the subsequent influenza season (mid December 2007 to end April 2008) with weekly phone calls and instructed to return to the study clinics for any acute respiratory illness, at which time a combined nasal andthroatswabforviralculturewasobtained.Theprimaryefficacy endpoint for this study was the development of culture-confirmed CDC-ILI, and we also assessed the effect of vaccination on rates of any influenza culture positive illness.

A total of 582 subjects were cultured for respiratory illness, and influenza virus was isolated from 178 subjects. There were a total of 120 subjects from whom influenza A was isolated, the majority of whom (82/120, 68%) met the CDC-ILI case definition. There were a total of 59 subjects with positive cultures for influenza B, and the majority of these subjects (41/59, 69%) also met the CDC-ILI case definition.

Only 8 isolates in the study (&lt;5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine. All of these viruses were A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like H3N2 viruses. Two of these occurred in FluBlok recipients and 6 occurred in placebo recipients, and among these subjects one FluBlok recipient and 5 placebo recipients met the CDC-ILI definition. Therefore, we were unable to obtain a meaningful estimate of the efficacy of FluBlok against CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the vaccine.

The remaining 111 influenza A viruses were characterized as antigenic variants, i.e., they exhibited a 4-fold or greater decrease in reactivity with post infection ferret antisera in reciprocal HAI testing. These viruses included 12 H1N1 viruses antigenically resembling H1 drift variant A/Brisbane/59/2007, 41 H3N2 viruses antigenically resembling the H3 drift variant A/Brisbane/10/2007, 42H3N2virusesthat could not be identified as either A/Wisconsinlike or A/Brisbane-like, and 16 influenza viruses for which the subtype was not determined. Fifty-eight of the 59 influenza B viruses (98%) were antigenically similar to B/Florida/04/2006, representing a different clade from the vaccine strain, and one influenza B virus could not be antigenically characterized.

The cumulative rates of culture confirmed influenza illness occurring in the study population over time are shown in Fig. 2, which shows that the relative difference between the two study groups remained constant throughout the influenza season. The incidence of this and of other related endpoints in the study by group are shown in Table 3. The overall protective efficacy of FluBlok against culture positive CDC-ILI regardless of strain was 44.6% (95% CI 18.8%, 62.6%). As expected given the more extreme degree of antigenic mismatch for the influenza B component, the efficacy of FluBlok was greater against CDC-ILI due to influenza A viruses (54.4%) than influenza B viruses (23.1%), although the difference was not statistically significant ( P =.20 by logistic regression). However,wewerenotabletodemonstrateastatisticallysignificant effect for influenza B. As shown in Table 3, there were no substantial differences between the point estimates of efficacy against culture positive CDC-ILI or against any culture positive illness.

## Claim 2

**Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.**

### Analysis

The evidence generally supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA of standard-dose flu vaccines and that this increased HA content has been linked to greater immunogenicity.  Several pieces of evidence directly state the 3x HA content.  Some evidence demonstrates increased immunogenicity through higher antibody titers in Flublok recipients.  However, the evidence also highlights the complexity of immunogenicity, noting factors like prior vaccination history can influence antibody responses. There's also a call for more data on the relative effectiveness compared to standard-dose vaccines in younger adults.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence simply states the section heading "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY" and "12.1 Mechanism of Action," offering no information relevant to the claim.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This section explains that Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins and that these induce a humoral immune response. It touches upon the mechanism of action but doesn't address the quantity of HA or compare it to standard-dose vaccines. While it mentions the immune response, it doesn't quantify or compare the magnitude of the response.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence explicitly states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (like Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines. This directly supports a key part of the claim. It also mentions a need for more data on relative effectiveness, which doesn't contradict the claim but highlights an area requiring further research.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence demonstrates that Flublok induced substantially higher antibody titers compared to placebo, suggesting greater immunogenicity.  It also notes that prior vaccination history influences responses, adding a nuance to the concept of immunogenicity.  While not directly stating "3x HA," the significantly higher antibody titers support the link between higher HA content and increased immune response.

#### Evidence 5

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This section focuses on adverse events and pregnancies during the study, which is not relevant to the claim about HA content and immunogenicity.

#### Evidence 6

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence is identical to Evidence 3 and explicitly states the 3x HA content compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines.  It also mentions the need for further data on relative effectiveness.

#### Evidence 7

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: While not directly stating "3x," this evidence discusses RIV4 (another name for Flublok) and highlights its ability to induce higher magnitudes of antibody responses compared to other flu vaccines, including standard-dose options.  This supports the part of the claim regarding increased immunogenicity linked to higher HA content.  It also discusses broader cross-reactivity, which isn't directly part of the claim but further suggests immunological advantages.

#### Evidence 2 (Score: 0.9142, Source: FlublokPI.pdf, Paragraph: 90.0, Type: text)

## 12.1 Mechanism of Action

Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody).

Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine.

#### Evidence 4 (Score: 0.8733, Source: Treanor et al. (2011).pdf, Paragraph: 39.0, Type: text)

Serum HAI antibody titers before and after immunization in FluBlok and placebo recipients are shown in Table 2. FluBlok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in FluBlok than in placebo recipients ( P &lt;.001 for all comparisons). The proportion of FluBlok recipients with a post-vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5%), 97% for the H3 component (94.8%, 98.3%), and 96% for the B component (94.0%, 97.8%).

Among FluBlok recipients, subjects with a self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccine in the year prior to the study had higher baseline titers of antibody against all three components, and had significantly lower frequencies of HAI response than did those who reported that they had not received vaccine in the previous year. Subjects who reported prior vaccine receipt also had lower post vaccination GMTs for all three components than did those without this history, and this difference was statistically significant for both influenza A components.

In a study by Nachbagauer et al. 78 , RIV4 induced HA stemspeci /uniFB01 c neutralising antibodies directed against in /uniFB02 uenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78 . RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speci /uniFB01 c to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax ® [Trivalent]) 77 . Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to eggor mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (Flucelvax ® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone ® quadrivalent SD, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) 60 . These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12,81 .

RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al. 82 , participants aged 65 -74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion inactivated trivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Fluzone ® High Dose, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3) 82 . Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cellpropagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain ( p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and

## Claim 3

**Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.**

### Analysis

The evidence strongly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.  Multiple pieces of evidence describe how the adaptation of influenza viruses to growth in eggs or cell cultures can lead to mutations, particularly in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. These mutations can cause antigenic mismatch, resulting in reduced vaccine effectiveness. While the evidence acknowledges that quality control measures aim to minimize these mutations, the risk remains, and the process of adapting viruses for vaccine production can also delay vaccine availability.  The evidence also highlights the development and use of recombinant HA vaccines as a way to avoid this issue.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence explicitly discusses how egg-adaptation of a flu vaccine strain led to the absence of a crucial glycosylation site, resulting in poor antibody neutralization of the circulating strain. It also mentions the stringent quality controls in place to minimize the risk of deleterious mutations but acknowledges that adaptation time can hinder vaccine availability. Finally, it points out that recombinant technology eliminates this risk.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This piece clearly describes the potential for antigenic mismatch due to adaptive mutations in HA during vaccine production in eggs or cells. It provides specific examples of mutations that arose during vaccine manufacturing and were linked to reduced vaccine effectiveness.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence mentions the modest effectiveness of egg-based vaccines and highlights how egg-adaptation and the associated glycosylation issues can reduce vaccine effectiveness, particularly against A(H3N2) strains.  It promotes egg-free vaccines as a solution to this problem.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence primarily lists references and URLs, not providing direct information related to the claim.

#### Evidence 5

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence discusses allergic reactions and contraindications related to different influenza vaccine types, which is not relevant to the claim about mutations and effectiveness.

#### Evidence 6

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt mentions that a specific vaccine (Flublok) hasn't been evaluated for mutagenic potential.  This lack of information on one specific vaccine doesn't address the broader claim about the general potential for mutations in egg- and cell-based vaccines.

#### Evidence 7

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This text reinforces the idea that egg-adaptation can lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness and notes that cell-cultured and recombinant vaccines are designed to avoid this issue. While it focuses on comparing the effectiveness of different vaccine types, it implicitly acknowledges the mutation problem with egg-based production.

#### Evidence 8

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This introduction explicitly mentions the drawbacks of egg-based vaccine production, including the need for adaptation which can select for receptor variants that are not optimal and may not be representative of circulating strains.  It proposes recombinant baculovirus expression as a superior alternative.

#### Evidence 9

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Similar to Evidence 4, this is primarily a list of references and therefore not relevant to the claim.

#### Evidence 10

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This is another list of references and does not provide direct information related to the claim.

#### Evidence 11

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This is a section heading about nonclinical toxicology and doesn't contain information relevant to the claim.

#### Evidence 12

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence focuses on allergic reactions to vaccine components, not the potential for mutations during production.

Lower vaccine effectiveness estimates have been observed for H3N2 than for other strains since 2009, even during seasons when the selected vaccine strain appeared to be well matched to circulating strains 27 . Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.

Recombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ' live ' in /uniFB02 uenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the G lobal Initiative on Sharing All In /uniFB02 uenza Data (GISAID) database and is con /uniFB01 rmed for /uniFB01 delity at the working virus bank level 28 . As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype in /uniFB02 uenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated.

## POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE

A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 .

## 1. Introduction

Despite the availability of an array of influenza vaccines and recommendations for vaccination of individuals age 6 months

and over, influenza remains a major cause of morbidity, hospitalizations and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Over the last 1-2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose influenza vaccine has been modest [1-5]. New influenza vaccine formulations, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vaccines, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years, including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addition, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recombinant technologies have been licensed that avoid the glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation [6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) strains.

Despite the availability of an array of influenza vaccines and recommendations for vaccination of individuals age 6 months

and over, influenza remains a major cause of morbidity, hospitalizations and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Over the last 1-2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose influenza vaccine has been modest [1-5]. New influenza vaccine formulations, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vaccines, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years, including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addition, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recombinant technologies have been licensed that avoid the glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation [6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) strains.

Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend upon having access to a sufficient number of recipients of any given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 % against laboratory-confirmed influenza [7] and 27 % against influenza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown significant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries ( /C21 65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell-cultured quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza-related hospital encounters [10]. However, the study was limited by the fact that there were no laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes. Thus, the full benefit of cell-culture vaccine technology is still largely unknown.

## 1. Introduction

Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza

viruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].

Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in

young adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].

In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults.

As is  the  case  for  all  vaccines,  influenza  vaccines  contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications  to  their  use  a  history  of  previous  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, although rare,  can  occur  after  influenza  vaccination,  even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, identifying the causative component without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be  difficult.  Severe  allergic  reactions  after  vaccination  with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition  to  development of allergic  manifestations  in affected persons ( 92-94 ). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions  can  occur,  ACIP  recommends  the  following  for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3):

- •  For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4:
- 0 A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each individual  egg-based  IIV4  and  LAIV4  is  also contraindicated  for  persons  who  have  had  a  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of  that  vaccine  (excluding  egg)  (see  Persons  with  a History of Egg Allergy).
- •  For ccIIV4:
- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in  such  instances,  vaccination  should  occur  in  an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised  by  a  health  care  provider  who  is  able  to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction.
- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4.

## Claim 4

**Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.**

### Analysis

The evidence primarily focuses on recombinant influenza vaccines, specifically those using recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA). Several pieces of evidence support the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, particularly due to preservation of the HA stem and lack of chemical modifications.  However, some evidence focuses on the safety and general efficacy of recombinant vaccines without specifically addressing cross-protection in mismatch seasons.  Other evidence is irrelevant to the claim, focusing on statistical analysis or unrelated vaccine properties. There's limited direct evidence of effectiveness *specifically* during a mismatch season, though Treanor et al (2011) provides some support in this area. Overall, the evidence leans towards supporting the claim, but further research specifically focused on cross-protection in mismatch seasons would strengthen the conclusion.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence directly addresses the claim by highlighting how the glycosylation and accessibility of the HA stem in recombinant vaccines produced in insect cells contribute to cross-protection against mismatched influenza strains. This is further supported by the increased titre of broadly neutralizing HA stem-reactive antibodies observed in studies using recombinant vaccines.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence discusses how recombinant HA antigens are not subject to chemical modifications like conventional vaccines, preserving the native HA conformation. While this implies a potential advantage for broader immune response, it doesn't directly demonstrate cross-protection in a mismatch season. The preserved conformation *could* lead to better responses, but that's not directly shown here.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence focuses on the statistical analysis of a vaccine effectiveness study, which is not directly related to the claim about broader immune response and cross-protection.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence discusses the statistical methodology and power calculations for a study comparing recombinant and standard-dose vaccines, which is not relevant to the claim about cross-protection.

#### Evidence 5

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence describes a study demonstrating the efficacy of a recombinant rHA0 vaccine in preventing culture-confirmed influenza despite a significant antigenic mismatch.  This directly supports the claim of cross-protection in a mismatch season.

#### Evidence 6

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This is a list of references, not evidence itself.

#### Evidence 7

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt refers to a section on nonclinical toxicology, which is not directly related to the claim.

#### Evidence 8

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Disagrees
- **Reasoning**: While it explains that antibodies to one variant might not protect against a new variant, it also explains that the rHA proteins induce humoral immune responses.  This is a general statement about influenza and doesn't directly address the potential for *broader* response from recombinant vaccines. It focuses on the limitations of traditional responses rather than the potential advantages of recombinant technology.

#### Evidence 9

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence describes the availability and composition of RIV4, but doesn't address the claim about broader immune response or cross-protection.

#### Evidence 10

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence details the dosage, administration, contraindications, and precautions for RIV4, but doesn't provide information regarding its efficacy in providing cross-protection.

#### Evidence 11

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence mentions a study comparing the effectiveness of recombinant and standard-dose vaccines but provides no details on the results, so it doesn't address the claim.

#### Evidence 12

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This simply indicates the journal homepage and mentions the word "vaccine," providing no relevant information to the claim.

### Supporting Evidence

#### Evidence 1 (Score: 0.8341, Source: Arunachalam et al. (2021).pdf, Paragraph: 37.0, Type: text)

In addition to the above referenced studies, in a recent study by Shinde et al. 83 baculovirus-expressed rHA generated crossprotective responses against both circulating and drifted A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher risk for in /uniFB02 uenza and associated medical complications 83,84 . This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched in /uniFB02 uenza strains 12,75 . The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza.

## RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS

In all conventional in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines, whether derived from eggs or mammalian cells, the antigens are exposed to inactivation agents such as formaldehyde or β -propiolactone (BPL). These inactivating agents cause numerous modi /uniFB01 cations to the antigenic epitopes on HA through cross-linking or formation of bis-alkylated groups 85 87 -. These modi /uniFB01 cations often result in changes to protein folding, conformation, and stability 88 . Unlike conventional vaccines, RIV4 does not go through an inactivation step, thus preserving the native HA conformation of the wild-type virus, required for optimal protective immune response.

The relative  vaccine  effectiveness  was  based on the hazard ratio (1 minus the hazard ratio, expressed as a percentage). This calculation estimated the percent reduction in the incidence of the  outcome in the recombinant-vaccine group as  compared  with  that  in  the  standard-dose group. The proportional-hazards assumption of the Cox regression was evaluated, and no violation was found (Fig. S1).

For  secondary  objectives  in  participants  between the ages of 50 and 64 years, we adjusted for  multiplicity  by  Holm's  method. 10 Subgroup analyses involving participants with preexisting conditions were not adjusted for multiplicity. We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used propensity scores in alternative ways, used a robust variance estimator, stratified risk sets according to  facility  and  vaccination  week,  and  specified age as a spline (see the Supplementary Methods section).

To assess possible residual confounding, we examined  PCR-confirmed  RSV  infection  as  a negative control outcome because we would not expect influenza vaccination to be associated with a reduction in this infection. A nontrivial association between receipt of the recombinant vaccine  and  RSV  infection  would  suggest  bias  in our estimate of the relative vaccine effectiveness against  influenza.  Conversely,  a  finding  of  no association between receipt of the recombinant vaccine and RSV infection would be reassuring that  our  estimates  of  relative  vaccine  effectiveness were not biased by unmeasured factors that might  affect  the  risk  of  both  laboratory-confirmed  RSV  infection  and  influenza.  All  data analyses  were  performed  with  the  use  of  SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

## Statistical Analysis

We tested the null hypotheses that the recombinant vaccine would not be any more or any less effective than a standard-dose vaccine against influenza, using a two-sided test with a P value of  less  than  0.05  indicating  statistical  significance. We estimated that the administration of 400,000 doses each of the two vaccine formulations to patients between the ages of 18 and 64 years each influenza season would provide the study with 86% power to detect a relative vaccine effectiveness  of  10.0%  against  PCR-confirmed influenza. On the basis of previous data, we estimated the occurrence of 2.18 PCR-confirmed influenza  cases  per  1000  participants  in  the standard-dose group.

We used Cox regression analysis to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals for the recombinant vaccine as compared  with  a  standard-dose  vaccine  for  each outcome. The model specified a calendar time scale and included adjustments for sex, race or ethnic group, and age and an age-squared factor (in case age and risk had either a linear or curvilinear association). Risk sets were formed on each date on which at least one outcome event occurred  in  either  study  group.  Each  risk  set contained every participant in follow-up on that calendar date. Most of the participants had been vaccinated before the beginning of the influenza season  and  were  included  in  every  risk  set throughout the season.

The Cox model also used stabilized weights that were based on propensity scores. The statistical  analysis plan prespecified the use of propensity scores if imbalances were found in any study variables. We observed modest imbalances at some facilities in one or both seasons, although not overall (Tables S4 and S5). Thus, we created propensity scores that were specific for each facility  and  season.  The  propensity  scores  were derived  by  logistic  regression  to  estimate  the probability of the receipt of a recombinant vaccine  rather  than  a  standard-dose  vaccine  with respect  to  sex,  race,  age,  coexisting  illnesses,

indicators of health care-seeking behavior (e.g., previous  influenza  vaccination),  2-month  intervals of calendar time, and other factors. Missing data were not imputed.

Background: Development of influenza vaccines that do not use embryonated eggs as the substrate for vaccine production is a high priority. We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).

Methods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.

Results: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.

Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody).

Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine.

Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of RIV4. RIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV , ccIIV , or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution for the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for  the  reaction.  Moderate  or  severe  acute  illness  with  or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination ( 42 ). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). RIV4 is not licensed for children aged &lt;18 years.

## Claim 5

**Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.**

### Analysis

The evidence presents a mixed picture regarding the claim. Several pieces of evidence indicate that recombinant flu vaccines (like Flublok) contain a higher dose of hemagglutinin (HA) than standard-dose egg-based vaccines. This higher HA content suggests the potential for a more robust antibody response. However, direct comparisons of antibody responses between the two vaccine types are limited in the provided evidence. While some studies suggest improved responses with recombinant vaccines, particularly in certain age groups or against specific strains, others haven't found significant differences.  Crucially, the evidence highlights the need for more data on the relative effectiveness of the two vaccine types.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: States that recombinant vaccines have three times the HA of standard-dose vaccines, suggesting potential for a stronger response, but explicitly says data is needed on relative effectiveness.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Identical to Evidence 1; reiterates higher HA content in recombinant vaccines but acknowledges the need for further data on effectiveness.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 3/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Discusses the potential for recombinant vaccines to generate cross-protective responses and increased titres of broadly neutralizing antibodies, particularly due to higher quantity and accessibility of HA. However, it focuses on cross-protection rather than a direct comparison of antibody response magnitude against standard-dose vaccines.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 3/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Identical to Evidence 3; discusses cross-protective responses and potential benefits of recombinant vaccines due to HA characteristics but doesn't directly compare antibody levels to standard-dose vaccines.

#### Evidence 5

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Lists references related to influenza vaccines and immune responses but doesn't specifically address recombinant vaccines or their comparison to standard-dose vaccines.

#### Evidence 6

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Confirms that RIV4 contains a higher total HA content (180 µg) compared to implied standard dose, but doesn't directly compare antibody responses.

#### Evidence 7

- **Relevancy Score**: 3/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Mentions studies showing antibody responses with rHA0 vaccines similar to egg-derived vaccines, but doesn't specifically compare high-dose recombinant vaccines to standard-dose egg-based vaccines.

#### Evidence 8

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Provides general information and abbreviations related to influenza vaccines but doesn't contain information relevant to the claim.

#### Evidence 9

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Explains how Flublok induces humoral immunity and discusses antigenic drift but doesn't compare its antibody response to standard-dose vaccines.

#### Evidence 10

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Simply a section heading about nonclinical toxicology; irrelevant to the claim.

#### Evidence 11

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Mentions the introduction of high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines, along with egg-free options like recombinant vaccines, aiming to improve upon the modest effectiveness of standard-dose vaccines.  This indirectly supports the idea that recombinant vaccines might induce a better response, but doesn't provide direct evidence.

#### Evidence 12

- **Relevancy Score**: 3/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Discusses studies comparing RIV4 to SD-IIV4 and mentions some evidence of higher relative effectiveness in certain populations, but also notes a lack of significant difference in others.  It doesn't specifically focus on antibody response magnitude.

In addition to the above referenced studies, in a recent study by Shinde et al. 83 baculovirus-expressed rHA generated crossprotective responses against both circulating and drifted A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher risk for in /uniFB02 uenza and associated medical complications 83,84 . This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched in /uniFB02 uenza strains 12,75 . The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza.

## 1. Introduction

Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza

viruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].

Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in

young adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].

In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults.

## 1. Introduction

Despite the availability of an array of influenza vaccines and recommendations for vaccination of individuals age 6 months

and over, influenza remains a major cause of morbidity, hospitalizations and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Over the last 1-2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose influenza vaccine has been modest [1-5]. New influenza vaccine formulations, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vaccines, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years, including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addition, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recombinant technologies have been licensed that avoid the glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation [6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) strains.

---

#### Evidence 12 (Score: 0.7931, Source: Zimmerman et al. (2023).pdf, Paragraph: 13.0, Type: text)

Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend upon having access to a sufficient number of recipients of any given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 % against laboratory-confirmed influenza [7] and 27 % against influenza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown significant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries ( /C21 65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell-cultured quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza-related hospital encounters [10]. However, the study was limited by the fact that there were no laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes. Thus, the full benefit of cell-culture vaccine technology is still largely unknown.

Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against influenza-related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults /C21 50 years old, but not for adults /C21 65 years old [11].

Given the higher cost of newer vaccines, and the high risk of influenza complications for certain groups, including the elderly [12], there is interest in providing the most effective vaccine to the largest number of patients to prevent influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Additional rVE studies of new vaccine formulations are needed to help determine vaccination best practices. This study is a retrospective test-negative case-control study of influenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18-64 and /C21 65 years of age in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons.

## Claim 6

**Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).**

### Analysis

The evidence strongly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent) in a pivotal trial.  Evidence 1 and 2 from the Flublok Product Insert (PI) explicitly state that Study 6 compared Flublok Quadrivalent to Fluarix Quadrivalent as a comparator in adults 50 years and older. Evidence 1 also mentions Study 7, which used Fluarix Quadrivalent as a comparator in adults 18-49 years of age.

Study 6 (NCT02285998) enrolled subjects 50 years of age and older, randomized to receive Flublok Quadrivalent or Comparator (Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) as an active control [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The safety analysis population included 4328 Flublok Quadrivalent recipients and 4344 Comparator vaccine recipients. The mean age of participants was 62.7 years. Overall, 58% of subjects were female, 80% white/Caucasian, 18% black/African American, 0.9% American Indian/ Alaskan Native, 0.4% Asian, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 0.7% other racial groups, and 5% of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.

Among adults 50 years of age and older (Study 6), there were no SAEs considered related to study vaccine.

Study 7 (NCT02290509) enrolled subjects 18 through 49 years of age randomized to receive Flublok Quadrivalent or a Comparator inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluarix ® Quadrivalent, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline). The safety analysis population included 998 recipients of Flublok Quadrivalent and 332 Comparator vaccine recipients. The mean age of participants was 33.5 years. Overall, 65% of subjects were female, 59% white/Caucasian, 37% black/African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 0.8% American Indian/Alaskan Native, 0.5% Asian, 1.4% other racial groups, and 16% of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.

Among adults 18-49 years of age (Study 7), through 6 months post-vaccination, there were no SAEs considered related to study vaccine.

#Secondary endpoint of trial.

ÞExploratory (prespecified) endpoint of trial.

The efficacy of Flublok Quadrivalent is relevant to Flublok because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions (see Description [11] ).

Study 6 evaluated the efficacy of Flublok Quadrivalent in a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial conducted during the 2014-2015 influenza season in adults 50 years of age and older. A total of 8963 healthy, medically stable adults (mean age 62.5 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok Quadrivalent (n=4474) or a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Comparator, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by Glaxo SmithKline) (n=4489).

Among randomized subjects, 58% were female, 80% white, 18% black/African-American, 2% other races, and 5% of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. A total of 5186 (60%) subjects were 50-64 years of age and 3486 (40%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) -confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post- vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 6 months post- vaccination. ILI was defined as having at least one symptom (no specified duration) in each of two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms. Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever &gt; 99°F ( &gt; 37°C) oral, chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reflex viral culture of rtPCRpositive samples.

Quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines, and the recombinant formulation is not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing. Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard-dose vaccines against influenza-related outcomes in adults under the age of 65 years.

## 3.2. Immunogenicity

Serum HAI antibody titers before and after immunization in FluBlok and placebo recipients are shown in Table 2. FluBlok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in FluBlok than in placebo recipients ( P &lt;.001 for all comparisons). The proportion of FluBlok recipients with a post-vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5%), 97% for the H3 component (94.8%, 98.3%), and 96% for the B component (94.0%, 97.8%).

Among FluBlok recipients, subjects with a self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccine in the year prior to the study had higher baseline titers of antibody against all three components, and had significantly lower frequencies of HAI response than did those who reported that they had not received vaccine in the previous year. Subjects who reported prior vaccine receipt also had lower post vaccination GMTs for all three components than did those without this history, and this difference was statistically significant for both influenza A components.

## Claim 7

**Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).**

### Analysis

The evidence strongly supports the claim that Flublok is produced using a novel production platform involving recombinant HA expression in insect cells with a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).  Multiple sources explicitly describe this process, including the Flublok product insert itself.  While some evidence focuses on older formulations or specific studies, the core production method remains consistent.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt from the Flublok product insert directly describes the production process, mentioning the use of insect cells (expresSF+), baculovirus vectors, and purification steps. This aligns perfectly with the claim.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This section heading refers to the mechanism of action, which is not relevant to the production process.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt describes the production of Flublok (FluBlok) for a specific study, detailing the use of insect cells and a baculovirus expression system.  While specific to an older formulation, it confirms the core production method described in the claim.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This text explicitly states that RIV4 (Flublok) is produced using a "novel production platform" involving rHA expression in insect cells with a BEVS. It further details the process, including infection of insect cells with recombinant baculovirus, extraction, and purification.

#### Evidence 5

- **Relevancy Score**: 3/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt discusses the unique structural features of the rHA produced in insect cells and its impact on vaccine characteristics. It indirectly supports the claim by highlighting the novel aspects of the production process, including regulatory recognition of its novelty, but doesn't explicitly describe the BEVS process itself.

#### Evidence 6

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This text provides background on the advantages of using baculovirus expression in insect cells for vaccine production, including its speed and efficiency. It then mentions previous studies using baculovirus-expressed rHA0 in humans.  While focused on the rationale for the method and not a direct description of Flublok's production, it strongly supports the claim by confirming the use of this technology for Flublok's development.

## 11 DESCRIPTION

Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line ( expres SF+ ® ) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemicallydefined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.

Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.

A single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween ® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( ≤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( ≤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( ≤ 100 mcg).

Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single-dose, prefilled syringes contain no natural rubber latex.

## 2.1. Vaccine

The vaccine (FluBlok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg (as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay) of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza viruses recommended for the 2007-2008 influenza season formulated with 0.005% Tween ® -20 in 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 ± 0.4 without a preservative. Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein. Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection, USP.

and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster manufacture of in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential avian /uniFB02 u pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.

This review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.

Insect cell-derived rHA (RIV4) has been studied extensively by various groups in both pre-clinical models and humans. The rHA contained in RIV4 differs from that expressed in other systems in terms of speci /uniFB01 c structural features, the nature of the source material and the manufacturing process, which have an impact on certain aspects of vaccine safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy (Fig. 2). Based on these unique features, RIV4 received ' product exclusivity ' protection from FDA, a ' new active substance ' designation from EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 48 and an innovative drug ' ' designation from Health Canada 49 . The use of this technology, together with the molecular characterisation of the product, should facilitate continued evolution of in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines with improved effectiveness and their timely availability to the public.

Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza

viruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].

Expression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in

young adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].

In the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults.

## Claim 8

**Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.**

### Analysis

The evidence presents a mixed picture regarding the claim. Some excerpts directly support the claim by indicating that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies compared to egg-derived vaccines. However, other evidence focuses on the general immunogenicity and efficacy of recombinant vaccines without directly comparing them to egg-derived vaccines in terms of broadly cross-reactive antibody induction.  Several pieces of evidence focus on RIV4 (Flublok), a specific recombinant HA vaccine, making the evidence applicable to this particular vaccine rather than all BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens.  Furthermore, some evidence highlights the advantages of recombinant technology in vaccine production without discussing the specific immune response differences.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt explicitly states that recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared to egg-derived split vaccines, directly supporting the claim.  It specifically references the work of Portnoff et al.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence discusses the induction of stem-specific and head-specific antibodies by RIV4, a BEVS-produced recombinant HA vaccine. It mentions higher antibody magnitudes compared to egg- or mammalian cell-derived vaccines, suggesting broader antibody responses but doesn't explicitly compare cross-reactivity levels against conserved regions like Evidence 1.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt primarily discusses the advantages of baculovirus expression systems for vaccine production and the general immunogenicity of rHA0 vaccines. It doesn't directly compare the cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by recombinant vs. egg-derived vaccines.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This is a duplicate of Evidence 3 and therefore offers no additional relevant information.

#### Evidence 5

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt mentions nonclinical toxicology studies and is irrelevant to the claim about antibody responses.

#### Evidence 6

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Focuses on the general function of HA proteins in Flublok and antigenic drift, not the specific comparison in the claim.

#### Evidence 7

- **Relevancy Score**: 3/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Discusses the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of RIV4 compared to other vaccines, including standard-dose vaccines.  While relevant to the overall performance of RIV4, it doesn't specifically address cross-reactivity of antibodies against conserved HA regions.

#### Evidence 8

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Provides general information about RIV4, including its production method and dosage, but doesn't address the claim about cross-reactive antibodies.

#### Evidence 9

- **Relevancy Score**: 3/5
- **Assessment**: Partially Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Duplicate of Evidence 7.

#### Evidence 10

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: States the need for data comparing recombinant and standard-dose vaccines but doesn't provide such data or discuss cross-reactivity.

#### Evidence 11

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Simply lists authors of a study and is completely irrelevant to the claim.

#### Evidence 12

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: Provides information about different influenza vaccine formulations and their HA content, but doesn't address the comparative aspect of the claim regarding cross-reactive antibodies.

clearly demonstrate structural differences between HA pre-fusion and post-fusion states, and the presence of unique neutralising epitopes in the pre-fusion HA0 molecules, which are present in RIV4 (Fig. 2).

Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al. 64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (speci /uniFB01 cally for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced signi /uniFB01 cantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg-derived split vaccines 64 . Recently Richards et al. 65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive in /uniFB02 uenza seasons (2015 -2016, 2016 2017, -and 2017 2018) 65 -. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with signi /uniFB01 cantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other in /uniFB02 uenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine ef /uniFB01 cacy and long-term immunity 65 .

In a study by Nachbagauer et al. 78 , RIV4 induced HA stemspeci /uniFB01 c neutralising antibodies directed against in /uniFB02 uenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78 . RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speci /uniFB01 c to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax ® [Trivalent]) 77 . Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to eggor mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (Flucelvax ® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone ® quadrivalent SD, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) 60 . These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12,81 .

RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al. 82 , participants aged 65 -74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion inactivated trivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Fluzone ® High Dose, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3) 82 . Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cellpropagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain ( p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and

Flublok contains recombinant HA proteins of the three strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody).

Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine.

Reasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend upon having access to a sufficient number of recipients of any given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 % against laboratory-confirmed influenza [7] and 27 % against influenza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown significant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries ( /C21 65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell-cultured quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza-related hospital encounters [10]. However, the study was limited by the fact that there were no laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes. Thus, the full benefit of cell-culture vaccine technology is still largely unknown.

Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against influenza-related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults /C21 50 years old, but not for adults /C21 65 years old [11].

Given the higher cost of newer vaccines, and the high risk of influenza complications for certain groups, including the elderly [12], there is interest in providing the most effective vaccine to the largest number of patients to prevent influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Additional rVE studies of new vaccine formulations are needed to help determine vaccination best practices. This study is a retrospective test-negative case-control study of influenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18-64 and /C21 65 years of age in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons.

## Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4)

Available Vaccine. One  recombinant influenza  vaccine, Flublok  Quadrivalent  (RIV4),  is  expected  to  be  available during the 2022-23 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs ( 127 ).

Dosage and Administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 µ g of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 µ g total).

Two large studies have explored rVE of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4). The Medicare beneficiaries study [10] using retrospective data as described above, reported significant rVE of RIV4 vs. SD-IIV4) against influenza-related hospital encounters. Secondly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant rVE of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 among adults /C21 50 years old, but not for adults /C21 65 years old [11].

Given the higher cost of newer vaccines, and the high risk of influenza complications for certain groups, including the elderly [12], there is interest in providing the most effective vaccine to the largest number of patients to prevent influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Additional rVE studies of new vaccine formulations are needed to help determine vaccination best practices. This study is a retrospective test-negative case-control study of influenza VE against hospitalization using data from electronic medical records (EMR) of a single large health system to determine the rVE of RIV4 among adults 18-64 and /C21 65 years of age in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons.

## Claim 9

**Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.**

### Analysis

The evidence strongly supports the claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain and that standard-dose influenza vaccines contain 15 mcg HA per strain.  Several sources directly state this dosage information for both Flublok and standard dose vaccines.  Older studies on Flublok also corroborate the 45 mcg per strain dosage.

### Evidence Assessments

#### Evidence 1

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence only provides the section header "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY" and doesn't offer any information about HA content.

#### Evidence 2

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt from the Flublok Product Insert (PI) explicitly states that Flublok contains 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA for each of the three included influenza virus strains.

#### Evidence 3

- **Relevancy Score**: 4/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This excerpt from a 2011 study on Flublok confirms that the trivalent version of the vaccine contained 45 mcg of each purified rHA0. While referring to an older formulation and a different set of strains, it supports the claim regarding the amount of HA per strain in Flublok.

#### Evidence 4

- **Relevancy Score**: 2/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This section discusses the immune response to Flublok, not the specific HA content. While important for understanding the vaccine's effectiveness, it doesn't directly address the claim about HA quantity.

#### Evidence 5

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This evidence states that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (like Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines. This indirectly confirms the claim by establishing the 3x ratio (45 mcg being three times 15 mcg).

#### Evidence 6

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: Identical to Evidence 5; reiterates the 3x HA content of recombinant vaccines compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines.

#### Evidence 7

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This table clearly lists Flublok Quadrivalent as containing 45 mcg/0.5 mL of HA and other standard dose quadrivalent vaccines (like Fluad Quadrivalent) containing 15 mcg/0.5 mL.

#### Evidence 8

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence only mentions recommendations for influenza vaccine use, not the specific HA content of the vaccines.

#### Evidence 9

- **Relevancy Score**: 1/5
- **Assessment**: Not applicable
- **Reasoning**: This evidence just introduces a table of influenza vaccines but doesn't provide the data from the table itself.

#### Evidence 10

- **Relevancy Score**: 5/5
- **Assessment**: Agrees
- **Reasoning**: This text explicitly states that RIV4 (recombinant influenza vaccine, which includes Flublok) contains 45 µg of HA per strain compared to 15 µg for standard-dose inactivated vaccines.  It directly supports the claim.

#### Evidence 2 (Score: 0.9834, Source: FlublokPI.pdf, Paragraph: 88.0, Type: text)

Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line ( expres SF+ ® ) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemicallydefined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.

Flublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.

A single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween ® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( ≤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( ≤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( ≤ 100 mcg).

Flublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single-dose, prefilled syringes contain no natural rubber latex.

#### Evidence 3 (Score: 0.8953, Source: Treanor et al. (2011).pdf, Paragraph: 12.0, Type: text)

The vaccine (FluBlok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg (as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay) of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza viruses recommended for the 2007-2008 influenza season formulated with 0.005% Tween ® -20 in 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 ± 0.4 without a preservative. Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein. Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection, USP.

#### Evidence 4 (Score: 0.8879, Source: Treanor et al. (2011).pdf, Paragraph: 39.0, Type: text)

Serum HAI antibody titers before and after immunization in FluBlok and placebo recipients are shown in Table 2. FluBlok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in FluBlok than in placebo recipients ( P &lt;.001 for all comparisons). The proportion of FluBlok recipients with a post-vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5%), 97% for the H3 component (94.8%, 98.3%), and 96% for the B component (94.0%, 97.8%).

Among FluBlok recipients, subjects with a self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccine in the year prior to the study had higher baseline titers of antibody against all three components, and had significantly lower frequencies of HAI response than did those who reported that they had not received vaccine in the previous year. Subjects who reported prior vaccine receipt also had lower post vaccination GMTs for all three components than did those without this history, and this difference was statistically significant for both influenza A components.

have  been  modified.  ACIP  recommends  that  adults aged  ≥65  years  preferentially  receive  any  one  of  the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent  high-dose  inactivated  influenza  vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard-dose vaccines (60 µ g for HD-IIV4 and 45 µ g for RIV4, compared with 15 µ g for standard-dose inactivated vaccines). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4) contains MF59 adjuvant.
