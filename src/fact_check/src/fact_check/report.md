# Flublok Claims Verification Results

## Claim 1

**Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.**

### Analysis

The evidence partially supports the claim that Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains. Evidence 2 explains that Flublok is a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine utilizing hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from four strains.  Evidence 5 clarifies that the WHO and individual regulatory bodies (like the FDA) select the target influenza strains for inclusion in vaccines.  This implies Flublok *incorporates* the chosen strains.  However, the evidence doesn't confirm *identical antigenic match*. While Evidence 2 describes the production process using recombinant HA, it doesn't guarantee the final product perfectly mirrors the originally selected strains.  Evidence 4 even suggests that Flublok elicits a potentially *broader* antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines, which could imply slight antigenic differences, although aimed at improving cross-protection.  Evidence 1 and 3 simply list Flublok as a quadrivalent vaccine, providing no information regarding its antigenic match. Therefore, while the evidence demonstrates Flublok is designed *based on* the selected strains, it lacks information to definitively prove *identical* antigenic match.  Further research focusing on the antigenic characteristics of Flublok compared to the WHO/FDA-selected strains is necessary to fully assess the claim.

and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster manufacture of in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential avian /uniFB02 u pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.

#### Evidence 4 (Score: 0.6543, Source: Arunachalam et al. (2021).pdf)

In a study by Nachbagauer et al. 78 , RIV4 induced HA stemspeci /uniFB01 c neutralising antibodies directed against in /uniFB02 uenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78 . RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speci /uniFB01 c to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax ® [Trivalent]) 77 . Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to eggor mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (Flucelvax ® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone ® quadrivalent SD, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) 60 . These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12,81 .

The preparation of the annual in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine /uniFB01 rstly requires the identi /uniFB01 cation of the in /uniFB02 uenza strains and their like strains, most likely to spread during the upcoming season, for inclusion in the vaccine. Identi /uniFB01 cation of the target in /uniFB02 uenza strains is based on surveillance data collected by World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centres at six locations in the UK, USA (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]), Japan, China and Australia as part of the WHO Global In /uniFB02 uenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) 15 . The /uniFB01 nal decision on resulting vaccine targets is made by individual regulatory bodies.

## Claim 2

**Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.**

### Analysis

Evidence 2 directly supports the claim that Flublok contains 3x the HA antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines. The table clearly shows Flublok Quadrivalent contains 45 µg HA/0.5 mL dose, while the standard dose Fluad Quadrivalent contains 15 µg HA/0.5 mL dose, a three-fold difference.  Evidence 1 and Evidence 5 partially support the second part of the claim, linking higher HA content to greater immunogenicity. These studies show RIV4 (Flublok) induces higher antibody titers against some influenza strains compared to standard dose or adjuvanted vaccines, suggesting potentially improved immunogenicity.  However, Evidence 1 also acknowledges the need for more studies to verify whether the observed differences in antibody response translate to broader protection. Evidence 5 demonstrates improved responses against some circulating strains and a drifted H3N2 strain with RIV4, but titers against the drifted strain remained generally low across all vaccine groups.  Evidence 3 and Evidence 4 describe the recombinant HA production process of RIV4 and highlight its advantage in preserving glycosylation sites compared to egg-based vaccine production, which can impact vaccine effectiveness.  While relevant to the overall discussion of influenza vaccine development and potential benefits of RIV4, these do not directly address the claim about HA content and immunogenicity.  A key limitation across the evidence is the limited number of studies directly comparing Flublok to standard-dose vaccines, particularly in terms of clinical outcomes like reduced illness. While antibody responses are suggestive of improved immunity, they don't definitively prove greater effectiveness in preventing influenza.

The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain ( p = 0.003).

## Claim 3

**Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.**

### Analysis

Evidence 1 and 2 strongly support the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines can develop mutations during production, potentially reducing their effectiveness.  These pieces of evidence detail specific instances where egg-adapted strains acquired mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, leading to reduced vaccine effectiveness in multiple flu seasons. The examples of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), and the clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain clearly demonstrate how these mutations can lead to antigenic mismatch and poor antibody neutralization of circulating viruses. Evidence 2 also highlights the issue of altered glycosylation patterns in egg-adapted strains further contributing to reduced effectiveness. While Evidence 2 mentions stringent quality control measures aimed at minimizing the risk of such mutations, it acknowledges that the time required for these processes can hinder timely vaccine availability, indirectly supporting the claim's implication of potential drawbacks to these production methods. Evidence 3, while discussing egg protein contamination, does not directly address the claim of mutations impacting effectiveness. Evidence 4 and 5 present recombinant HA vaccines as an alternative that avoids the risk of egg- or cell-adapted mutations.  These pieces of evidence effectively contradict the claim's application to recombinant vaccines by describing a production process based on cloned HA DNA, ensuring the expressed protein matches the wild-type virus.  Overall, the evidence presents a nuanced picture:  traditional egg-based methods are susceptible to mutations affecting efficacy, while recombinant technology circumvents this issue.

A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 .

In addition to the above referenced studies, in a recent study by Shinde et al. 83 baculovirus-expressed rHA generated crossprotective responses against both circulating and drifted A/H3N2 strains, including in older adults who are at a higher risk for in /uniFB02 uenza and associated medical complications 83,84 . This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched in /uniFB02 uenza strains 12,75 . The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza.

The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines that rely on in /uniFB02 uenza virions propagated in egg or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through eggor cell-adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process-related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg-protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This wellestablished and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic in /uniFB02 uenza and/or COVID-19.

In a study by Nachbagauer et al. 78 , RIV4 induced HA stemspeci /uniFB01 c neutralising antibodies directed against in /uniFB02 uenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78 . RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speci /uniFB01 c to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax ® [Trivalent]) 77 . Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to eggor mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (Flucelvax ® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone ® quadrivalent SD, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) 60 . These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12,81 .

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 .

RIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al. 82 , participants aged 65 -74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion inactivated trivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Fluzone ® High Dose, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3) 82 . Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cellpropagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain ( p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The /uniFB01 rst candidate recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist, Salmonella typhimurium /uniFB02 agellin type 2 29 . The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models 29 . In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability 30 . The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puri /uniFB01 ed HA protein) using a minimal number of bioreactors 31 . The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility 31 . This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32 . However, E. coli -expressed rHA proteins can be subject to misfolding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation 33 . They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31 . The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31 . These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of E. coli -expressed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines.

by integrating HA, capsid protein (M1) and neuraminidase (NA) expressed in insect cells 44 46 -. Although presenting proteins in VLP structures enhanced their immunogenicity, it compromised the purity of the vaccines considerably, as VLP structures also integrated both baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins. Elimination of these unwanted proteins from the vaccine required extensive disassembly and reassembly processing of puri /uniFB01 ed VLPs, which is a constraint for the commercial scale manufacturing of vaccines annually. It also raises the cost and the time it takes to bring the vaccines to the market. The yield and the cost of various manufacturing processes and technologies are critical elements to ensure adequate supply of vaccine at an affordable cost, especially in a pandemic situation. This aspect of the vaccine manufacturing has been discussed exhaustively in a report published by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and is not covered here 47 .

The evidence reviewed here demonstrates several advantages of the BEVS used in the manufacture of RIV4 over conventional in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines that rely on in /uniFB02 uenza virions propagated in egg or mammalian cells, split with detergents with or without further HA enrichment. The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through eggor cell-adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process-related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg-protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This wellestablished and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic in /uniFB02 uenza and/or COVID-19.

Structural differences in the HA polypeptides and rosettes between recombinant and split vaccines have been shown to result in differences, both qualitative and quantitative, in the immune response to vaccines in humans and animals. Portnoff et al. 64 demonstrated that recombinant HA antigens (speci /uniFB01 cally for the H3 strain) produced using BEVS (as used for RIV4), induced signi /uniFB01 cantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of the HA head and stem domains than egg-derived split vaccines 64 . Recently Richards et al. 65 examined CD4 T-cell and antibody responses in healthy adults who received egg-derived split vaccine, cell-derived split vaccine or RIV4 for three successive in /uniFB02 uenza seasons (2015 -2016, 2016 2017, -and 2017 2018) 65 -. RIV4 elicited the most robust responses, with signi /uniFB01 cantly higher T-cell and antibody levels than the other two vaccines. Authors postulated that simpler glycosylation of rHA and absence of other in /uniFB02 uenza viral proteins in RIV4 contributed to the observed robust immune response for RIV4 and emphasised the relevance of these features in determining vaccine ef /uniFB01 cacy and long-term immunity 65 .

In a study by Nachbagauer et al. 78 , RIV4 induced HA stemspeci /uniFB01 c neutralising antibodies directed against in /uniFB02 uenza subtypes H1, H3 and B haemagglutinin in an age-dependent manner in humans, with the highest titres observed in the elderly 78 . RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speci /uniFB01 c to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax ® [Trivalent]) 77 . Higher magnitudes of haemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 have also been observed with RIV4 compared to eggor mammalian cell-derived split vaccines (Flucelvax ® Tetra, Seqirus, and Fluzone ® quadrivalent SD, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) 60 . These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12,81 .

and egg-free technologies allowing for guaranteed and faster manufacture of in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines are needed to ensure timely delivery for upcoming epidemic seasons and during potential avian /uniFB02 u pandemics, when egg supply may be impacted. The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.

RIV4 is one of only two available in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines that are egg-free. Like other recombinant vaccines, expression of HA in insect cells does not depend on the generation of reassortant candidate vaccine viruses selected for robust growth in embryonated eggs or mammalian cell-lines. Instead, HA genetic sequences from the wild-type strains selected for inclusion in the vaccine are inserted into the BEVS, from which high yields of rHA are harvested and puri /uniFB01 ed (Fig. 1). This process requires less than half the time (2 -3 months) required for the manufacture of conventional in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines 42,43 . This is a critical advantage for the timely supply of in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine for both seasonal epidemics and in pandemic situations. VLPs have been produced successfully

A known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 .
