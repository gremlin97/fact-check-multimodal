        "evaluation": "**NOT SUPPORTED**\n\nThe evidence provided strongly refutes the claim that Flublok ensures an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.  Evidence 3 and 4 from the Treanor et al. (2011) study directly contradict this assertion.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n* **\"Only 8 isolates in the study (<5% of the total) were antigenically identical to the strains contained in the vaccine.\"** This statement clearly indicates that a very small percentage of isolated viruses were antigenically identical to the strains in the Flublok vaccine.  This directly contradicts the claim of an *identical* antigenic match.  The vast majority of isolates (over 95%) were *not* identical.\n\n* **The study details antigenic drift variants.** The study describes numerous influenza A viruses as \"antigenic variants,\" showing significantly reduced reactivity compared to the vaccine strains. This further demonstrates a lack of identical antigenic match.  The significant antigenic mismatch is explicitly noted for both influenza A and B strains.\n\n* **Efficacy data is not based on identical match.** The study reports overall efficacy of Flublok, but this efficacy is not attributable to an identical antigenic match, as the majority of circulating viruses were different from the vaccine strains.  The fact that efficacy was assessed despite the mismatch further highlights the lack of an identical match.\n\nEvidence 1 and 2 are irrelevant to the claim. They discuss non-clinical toxicology data (carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and fertility), which is unrelated to the antigenic properties of the vaccine.  These sections provide no information about the antigenic match between the vaccine and circulating strains.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Flublok does *not* ensure an identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.  The claim is therefore definitively NOT SUPPORTED.\n",

However, the claim that this *has been linked to* greater immunogenicity is only partially supported.  Let's break down the evidence:\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n\n* **Evidence 3 & 6:** These explicitly state that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (like Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines.  This directly supports the first part of the claim.\n\n**Partially Supporting Evidence:**\n\n* **Evidence 4:** This shows that Flublok induced higher serum antibody responses (measured by HAI titers) than placebo.  This suggests greater immunogenicity.  However, it doesn't directly compare Flublok to standard-dose egg-based vaccines, only to a placebo.  While the higher antibody response is suggestive of increased immunogenicity compared to no vaccine, it doesn't definitively prove superior immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines.\n\n* **Evidence 7:** This evidence compares Flublok (referred to as RIV4) to other vaccines, showing higher antibody responses in some cases.  Again, this supports the idea of greater immunogenicity, but the comparison isn't solely against standard-dose vaccines and the study design and specific vaccines compared are not fully detailed.\n\n**Insufficient or Contradictory Evidence:**\n\n* **Evidence 1 & 2:** These provide background information on Flublok's mechanism of action but don't offer quantitative data on HA content or direct comparisons to other vaccines.\n* **Evidence 5:** This describes adverse events and pregnancy outcomes in a clinical trial, which is irrelevant to the claim about HA content and immunogenicity.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the assertion that Flublok contains three times the HA antigen content of standard-dose vaccines.  However, while the provided studies suggest Flublok may have greater immunogenicity, they don't definitively prove it compared to standard-dose vaccines.  The studies show higher antibody responses in Flublok recipients compared to placebo and in some cases to other vaccines, but direct, comprehensive comparisons to standard-dose vaccines are lacking.  Therefore, the claim is only partially supported.  More robust head-to-head comparative studies are needed to fully confirm the claim regarding superior immunogenicity.\n",

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody).\n\nAntibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine."

Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ' live ' in /uniFB02 uenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the G lobal Initiative on Sharing All In /uniFB02 uenza Data (GISAID) database and is con /uniFB01 rmed for /uniFB01 delity at the working virus bank level 28 . As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype in /uniFB02 uenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated."

Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -.

Over the last 1-2 decades, effectiveness of egg-based standard dose influenza vaccine has been modest [1-5]. New influenza vaccine formulations, designed to improve upon the effectiveness of these vaccines, have been introduced in the U.S. over the past several years, including high dose- and adjuvanted egg-based vaccines. In addition, egg-free vaccines manufactured using cell-culture and recombinant technologies have been licensed that avoid the glycosylation site binding issues associated with egg adaptation [6] that have been shown to reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) strains.\n\nReasonably accurate VE and relative VE (rVE) estimates depend upon having access to a sufficient number of recipients of any given vaccine type. Research on high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) has reported rVE for HD-IIV4 compared with standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (SD-IIV4) of 24 % against laboratory-confirmed influenza [7] and 27 % against influenza hospitalization [8]. Several studies of cell-cultured influenza vaccine were conducted prior to the 2019-2020 season (when all four vaccine strains were cell-cultured) and have not shown significant rVE against influenza illness compared with SD-IIV4 [9]. A large retrospective study of Medicare beneficiaries ( /C21 65 years of age) in the 2019-2020 season demonstrated no significant rVE of cell-cultured quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) compared with SD-IIV4 against influenza-related hospital encounters [10]. However, the study was limited by the fact that there were no laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes. Thus, the full benefit of cell-culture vaccine technology is still largely unknown."

          "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nAlthough embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

          "text": "As is  the  case  for  all  vaccines,  influenza  vaccines  contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications  to  their  use  a  history  of  previous  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, although rare,  can  occur  after  influenza  vaccination,  even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, identifying the causative component without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be  difficult.  Severe  allergic  reactions  after  vaccination  with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition  to  development of allergic  manifestations  in affected persons ( 92-94 ).

        "claim": "In medical literature, is it true that Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.?",
        "evaluation": "**PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**\n\nThe evidence partially supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.  Several pieces of evidence highlight this potential, but the claim is not universally supported across all vaccine types and production methods.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n\n* **Evidence 1, 3, 4:** These pieces of evidence strongly suggest that egg-based vaccines are prone to mutations during production.  Evidence 1 explicitly mentions that egg adaptation can lead to the absence of glycosylation sites, reducing antibody neutralization. Evidence 3 details specific amino acid substitutions (e.g., Q223R, G225A, T160K) in egg-based vaccines due to egg adaptation. Evidence 4 directly links egg-adapted mutations (e.g., in A/California/07/2009 and A/Victoria/361/2011 strains) to reduced vaccine effectiveness.  These examples demonstrate that mutations arising from the egg-based production process can negatively impact vaccine efficacy.\n\n* **Evidence 7, 11:** These pieces of evidence indirectly support the claim by noting that egg-based vaccines have shown modest effectiveness over the past 1-2 decades, and that cell-cultured and recombinant vaccines were developed to *avoid* the issues associated with egg adaptation. This implies that the egg-adaptation process itself introduces problems, including mutations that reduce effectiveness.\n\n\n**Evidence Against Universal Support:**\n\n* **Evidence 1:** This same evidence also states that \"the chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control.\" This highlights that while mutations *can* occur, modern manufacturing processes aim to minimize this risk.\n\n* **Evidence 2:** This evidence, while showing egg-adapted substitutions, lacks sufficient context to definitively link these mutations to reduced effectiveness.\n\n* **Evidence 5, 6:** These are tables describing influenza vaccines and do not provide information about mutations or their impact on effectiveness.\n\n* **Evidence 8, 13:** These are lists of references and do not directly address the claim.\n\n* **Evidence 9, 16:** These discuss allergic reactions to vaccine components, not mutations affecting efficacy.\n\n* **Evidence 10, 15:** These relate to the lack of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity testing for a specific recombinant vaccine (Flublok), which is not directly relevant to the claim about mutations during production impacting effectiveness.\n\n* **Evidence 12:** This focuses on the advantages of recombinant baculovirus technology for vaccine production, highlighting its speed and efficiency and implying a *reduction* in the risk of mutations compared to egg-based methods.\n\n* **Evidence 14:** This is a list of references and does not directly address the claim.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence shows that mutations can occur during the production of egg-based influenza vaccines, and these mutations can lead to reduced effectiveness. However, the evidence also indicates that modern quality control measures aim to minimize this risk, and that alternative production methods like recombinant technology largely circumvent this problem. Therefore, the claim is only partially supported.  The statement is true for some vaccine types and production methods, but not universally applicable.\n",

Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ' live ' in /uniFB02 uenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the G lobal Initiative on Sharing All In /uniFB02 uenza Data (GISAID) database and is con /uniFB01 rmed for /uniFB01 delity at the working virus bank level 28 . As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype in /uniFB02 uenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated."

Compared to the cell-grown vaccine prototype viruses, the vaccine antigens from all 4 subtypes in the egg-based vaccines had HA substitutions due to egg-adaptation. A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV formulated in Fluzone IIV4 had Q223R substitution in both years, while the egg CVV used for Fluarix IIV4 and ccIIV4 in year 1 had G225A substitution instead (Table 1). For A(H3N2), year 1 egg-based vaccine had T160K (resulting in a loss of glycosylation motif at HA 158), L194P, and D225G egg-adapted changes, while year 2 egg-based vaccine had D190N and N246T substitutions. In /uniFB02 uenza B vaccine viruses remained the same in both years. Egg-based B/Victoria vaccine had T199I substitution, which can cause a loss of glycosylation motif at HA position 197; whereas egg-based B/Yamagata vaccine had a N197D substitution that can also cause a loss of glycosylation motif at HA position 197."

Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 ."

Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

            "text": "As is  the  case  for  all  vaccines,  influenza  vaccines  contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications  to  their  use  a  history  of  previous  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, although rare,  can  occur  after  influenza  vaccination,  even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, identifying the causative component without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be  difficult.  Severe  allergic  reactions  after  vaccination  with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition  to  development of allergic  manifestations  in affected persons ( 92-94 ). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions  can  occur,  ACIP  recommends  the  following  for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3):\n\n- •  For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4:\n- 0 A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each individual  egg-based  IIV4  and  LAIV4  is  also contraindicated  for  persons  who  have  had  a  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of  that  vaccine  (excluding  egg)  (see  Persons  with  a History of Egg Allergy).\n- •  For ccIIV4:\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in  such  instances,  vaccination  should  occur  in  an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised  by  a  health  care  provider  who  is  able  to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction.\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4.\n- •  For RIV4:\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of RIV4.

This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched in /uniFB02 uenza strains 12,75 . The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza.\n\n## RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS"

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018 -19 ( N =723) and 2019 -20 ( N =684) in /uniFB02 uenza seasons. We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-eggbased vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immunememorytoegg-adaptedepitopesandre-focustheimmuneresponses towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.\n\nIn /uniFB02 uenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory infections in humans, annual in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination has been recommended in the United States (US) for many decades. Conventionally, in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine seed viruses are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs to produce inactivated in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines (IIV). However, this manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating in /uniFB02 uenza strains 1 -6 . Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that donot rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including\n\na cell culture-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent ™ by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent® by Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 µ g HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µ g HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are currently licensed in the US . Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have 7 shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups 8 13 -. Observational studies and clinical trials reported that ccIIV and RIV demonstrated modest to signi /uniFB01 cant improvement of VE over egg-based IIV in different age groups and in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 7,14 -16 .\n\nWepreviously reported that antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines .

        "claim": "In medical literature, is it true that Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.?",
        "evaluation": "**Evaluation:** PARTIALLY SUPPORTED\n\nThe evidence presented partially supports the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and potential cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.  However, the support is not conclusive and is based on specific studies with limitations.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSeveral pieces of evidence suggest a broader immune response with recombinant influenza vaccines:\n\n* **Evidence 1:** This is the strongest piece of evidence supporting the claim.  It cites studies (Shinde et al., Nachbagauer et al., Belongia et al.) showing that baculovirus-expressed recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) generated cross-protective responses against different influenza strains, including in older adults.  The mechanism is suggested to be related to the glycosylation of rHA in insect cells, leading to better accessibility of the conserved stem region.\n\n* **Evidence 5:** This study (Treanor et al., 2011) demonstrates that a trivalent rHA vaccine (FluBlok) was effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza, even with antigenic mismatch. This directly supports the claim of cross-protection in a mismatch season.\n\n* **Evidence 8:** This study (Liu et al., 2024) compares recombinant (RIV4), cell-culture based (ccIIV4), and egg-based (IIV4) influenza vaccines.  It shows that RIV4 induced higher neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) in year 1 and that repeat vaccination with RIV4 or ccIIV4 improved antibody responses to circulating viruses, suggesting a potential advantage in cross-protection.  However, the study notes that multiple seasons of non-egg-based vaccination might be needed for optimal effect.\n\nHowever, several aspects weaken the overall support:\n\n* **Lack of comprehensive meta-analysis:** The evidence relies on individual studies, not a comprehensive meta-analysis of all relevant research on recombinant influenza vaccines and cross-protection.  This limits the generalizability of the conclusions.\n\n* **Mechanism not fully elucidated:** While Evidence 1 proposes a mechanism (glycosylation and stem region accessibility), this is a hypothesis, not a definitively proven cause of the observed cross-protection.\n\n* **Confounding factors:**  The studies cited don't explicitly rule out all potential confounding factors that could contribute to the observed broader immune response.  Evidence 3, for example, acknowledges the need for sensitivity analyses to address potential residual confounding.\n\n* **Evidence 2, 9, 10, 11:** These pieces of evidence describe the manufacturing process of recombinant vaccines and their components but do not directly address the claim of broader immune response or cross-protection.\n\nIn conclusion, while several studies suggest that recombinant influenza vaccines may offer broader protection and cross-protection, the evidence is not conclusive enough to fully support the claim. More robust, large-scale studies and meta-analyses are needed to definitively confirm the claim.  The existing evidence provides partial support, but further research is crucial.\n",

This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched in /uniFB02 uenza strains 12,75 . The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza.\n\n## RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS"

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2.

However, this manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating in /uniFB02 uenza strains 1 -6 . Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that donot rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including\n\na cell culture-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent ™ by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent® by Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 µ g HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µ g HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are currently licensed in the US . Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have 7 shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups 8 13 -.

          "text": "Repeat vaccination with egg-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018 -19 ( N =723) and 2019 -20 ( N =684) in /uniFB02 uenza seasons. We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-eggbased vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immunememorytoegg-adaptedepitopesandre-focustheimmuneresponses towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.\n\nIn /uniFB02 uenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory infections in humans, annual in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination has been recommended in the United States (US) for many decades. Conventionally, in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine seed viruses are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs to produce inactivated in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines (IIV). However, this manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating in /uniFB02 uenza strains 1 -6 . Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that donot rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including\n\na cell culture-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent ™ by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent® by Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 µ g HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µ g HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are currently licensed in the US . Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have 7 shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups 8 13 -. Observational studies and clinical trials reported that ccIIV and RIV demonstrated modest to signi /uniFB01 cant improvement of VE over egg-based IIV in different age groups and in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 7,14 -16 .\n\nWepreviously reported that antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines .

In this study, we analyzed neutralizing antibody responses to both egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses, and total binding antibodies to both HAheadandHAstalkamongHCPfollowing vaccination with RIV, ccIIV, and standard egg-based IIVs in two in /uniFB02 uenza seasons to investigate whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines can overcome the effect of prior repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines."

One study reported that repeat vaccination reduced antibody af /uniFB01 nity maturation to the HA antigens of all vaccine components from egg-based, cell-culture based, and recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines 20 . Thus far, there are few direct comparisons of immunogenicity of the three vaccine platforms in populations with a history of frequent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccinations. We recently reported the comparison of immunogenicity of ccIIV and RIV to eggbased standard dose IIVs among US healthcare personnel (HCP) aged 18 -64 years from a randomized, open-label trial during the 2018 -2019 season 27 and the 2019 -2020 season following repeat vaccination in 2 consecutive years 28,29 . Those comparisons were focused on the neutralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses only. RIV4 elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses than IIV4 against cell-propagated vaccine viruses 27 . Repeat vaccination with ccIIV4 or RIV4 in 2 seasons also resulted in signi /uniFB01 cantly higher post-vaccination antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses 29 . Most HCP participants had received egg-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines frequently during the preceding /uniFB01 ve seasons."

          "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nAlthough embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

        "evaluation": "**Partially Supported**\n\nThe evidence partially supports the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines induce a more robust antibody response than standard-dose egg-based vaccines.  However, the support is not conclusive and comes with caveats.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n\n* **Evidence 3 & 4 (Liu et al., 2024):** This study directly compares the immunogenicity of recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), cell culture-based vaccine (ccIIV4), and standard egg-based IIV4 in healthcare personnel over two influenza seasons.  The results show that in year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA-head binding antibodies to cell-propagated A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4.  In year 2, repeat vaccination with RIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses.  This directly supports the claim regarding a more robust antibody response for the recombinant vaccine.  Furthermore, the study notes that previous studies showed ccIIV and RIV demonstrated modest to significant improvement of vaccine effectiveness over egg-based IIVs.\n\n* **Evidence 7 & 8 (Arunachalam et al., 2021):** This evidence mentions studies showing that baculovirus-expressed recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) generated cross-protective responses, suggesting a potentially broader and more robust immune response compared to egg-based vaccines.  The authors attribute this to the higher quantity and accessibility of the HA stem region in the recombinant vaccine.  This indirectly supports the claim by highlighting a potential mechanism for enhanced immunogenicity.\n\n* **Evidence 10 (Grohskopf et al., 2023):** This mentions that RIV4 contains a higher dose of HA (45 µg/dose/strain vs 15 µg/dose/strain for standard-dose vaccines), which is a key factor in the claim.  However, this evidence doesn't directly demonstrate superior antibody response.\n\n**Contradictory or Insufficient Evidence:**\n\n* **Evidence 1 & 2 (Hsiao et al., 2023):**  These only state that data are *needed* on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines compared to standard-dose vaccines.  They don't provide any data supporting or refuting the claim.\n\n* **Evidence 5 & 6 (CDC Influenza vaccines.pdf):** These tables list various influenza vaccines and their HA content. While they show the higher HA content of RIV4, they do not provide data on antibody responses, thus offering no direct support for the claim.\n\n* **Evidence 9 (Treanor et al., 2011):** This mentions previous studies on recombinant HA vaccines showing antibody responses similar to egg-derived vaccines. This does not support the claim of a *more robust* response.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nWhile some studies directly show a superior antibody response for higher-dose recombinant vaccines compared to standard-dose egg-based vaccines, the evidence is not comprehensive.  More research is needed to definitively conclude that this holds true across all populations and influenza strains.  The existing evidence provides partial support, but further studies are necessary to fully validate the claim.  The studies cited often focus on specific aspects (e.g., neutralizing antibodies to certain strains) rather than a broad comparison of overall antibody response.\n",

            "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nAlthough embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) -confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post- vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 6 months post- vaccination. ILI was defined as having at least one symptom (no specified duration) in each of two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms. Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever &gt; 99°F ( &gt; 37°C) oral, chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reflex viral culture of rtPCRpositive samples."

        "claim": "In medical literature, is it true that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).?",
        "evaluation": "**SUPPORTED**\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the claim that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in a pivotal trial.  Evidence 1 and Evidence 2 explicitly state this.\n\n* **Evidence 1** clearly indicates that Study 6 (NCT02285998) included a comparison between Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluarix Quadrivalent (manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) as an active control in adults 50 years and older.  The text explicitly names Fluarix as the comparator.\n\n* **Evidence 2** further reinforces this by describing Study 6 as a \"randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial\" where Flublok Quadrivalent was compared to \"a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Comparator, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by Glaxo SmithKline)\".  This explicitly names Fluarix as the comparator vaccine in a pivotal efficacy trial.\n\nWhile other evidence mentions various influenza vaccines and their characteristics (Evidence 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12),  and some studies compare Flublok to other vaccines (Evidence 7, 11), none of these contradict the core claim.  Evidence 9 and 10 describe a study comparing Flublok to a placebo, not Fluarix, but this doesn't negate the pivotal trial comparison with Fluarix.\n\nTherefore, the provided evidence directly and repeatedly confirms the claim.  The claim is **SUPPORTED**.\n",

A total of 8963 healthy, medically stable adults (mean age 62.5 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok Quadrivalent (n=4474) or a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Comparator, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by Glaxo SmithKline) (n=4489).\n\nAmong randomized subjects, 58% were female, 80% white, 18% black/African-American, 2% other races, and 5% of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. A total of 5186 (60%) subjects were 50-64 years of age and 3486 (40%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) -confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post- vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 6 months post- vaccination. ILI was defined as having at least one symptom (no specified duration) in each of two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms. Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever &gt; 99°F ( &gt; 37°C) oral, chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reflex viral culture of rtPCRpositive samples."

Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0 pre-vaccination), 1-month, and 6-months post-vaccination. The Year 2 study was designed to evaluate the antibody responses following 7 different Year 1-Year 2 repeat vaccination regimens: IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0) and 1-month post-vaccination.\n\nFluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, the two egg-based vaccines were analyzed separately for this exploratory analysis because the two vaccines have different egg-adaptated mutation on the HA of the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV (Table 1). Fluzone has Q223R substitution which was associated with focused antibody response to 223R in some vaccinees as we previously reported 38 , while the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV in Fluarix had 223Q.

It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line ( expres SF+ ® ) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemicallydefined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.\n\nFlublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween ® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( ≤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( ≤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( ≤ 100 mcg).\n\nFlublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single-dose, prefilled syringes contain no natural rubber latex."

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains.

This directly confirms the core components of the claim.\n\nEvidence 3 further reinforces this by stating the vaccine used in the study (Flublok) \"consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system\".\n\nEvidence 4 provides the most detailed description, explicitly mentioning that Flublok's (referred to as RIV4) production \"is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS)\".  This evidence not only supports the claim but also highlights the \"novel\" aspect by contrasting it with traditional egg-based methods.  The description of the process (infection of insect cells with recombinant baculovirus, extraction with detergent, purification) further substantiates the claim's technical accuracy.\n\nWhile Evidence 2, 5, 7, and 8 provide valuable contextual information regarding Flublok's properties and comparisons with other influenza vaccines, they don't directly contradict or weaken the core claim regarding its production method.  Evidence 6 discusses the advantages of insect cell-based production over egg-based methods, indirectly supporting the claim's implication of a novel and advantageous approach.\n\nIn summary, the multiple pieces of evidence, particularly Evidence 1, 3, and 4, provide a comprehensive and consistent description of Flublok's production method, directly supporting the claim.  The additional evidence strengthens the context and significance of this novel production method.\n",

It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line ( expres SF+ ® ) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemicallydefined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.\n\nFlublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween ® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( ≤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( ≤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( ≤ 100 mcg).\n\nFlublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives.

However, for A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, the difference in HI antibody versus the total HA head binding antibody levels among 4 vaccine groups was less consistent, suggesting that the magnitude of improvement differ between subtypes and were likely determined by the relative immunodominance of the egg-adapted HA epitopes for each subtype. In addition, the egg/cell HA head binding ELISA titer ratios were around 1 for all vaccine antigen subtypes irrespective of vaccine platforms (Fig. 4B), suggesting the total HA binding antibody responses induced by vaccination cannot differentiate egg-adapted epitopes on HA even for A(H3N2). This is in stark contrast to the highly elevated egg/cell GMT ratio in neutralizing antibody responses to egg- vs cell-A(H3N2) viruses (Fig. 5A, B), highlighting the importance of inducing high quality, neutralizing antibody responses from vaccination.\n\nOur study also demonstrated that the impact of vaccine eggadaption may differ between in /uniFB02 uenza virus subtypes, with the biggest impact on neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) and moderate impact for in /uniFB02 uenza B vaccine viruses.

        "claim": "In medical literature, is it true that Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.?",
        "evaluation": "**Evaluation: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**\n\nThe evidence partially supports the claim.  Several studies cited in the provided text (primarily from Arunachalam et al. 2021 and Liu et al. 2024) show that recombinant HA antigens produced using the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS), specifically in the context of the RIV4 vaccine, elicit higher levels of certain antibodies compared to egg-derived vaccines.  However, the support is not unqualified and the claim needs clarification.\n\n**Reasons:**\n\n* **Specific to RIV4 and H3N2:** The strongest evidence focuses on the RIV4 vaccine and its performance against the A(H3N2) subtype.  Evidence 1 and 2 directly cite studies (Portnoff et al., Richards et al., Belongia et al.) showing RIV4 induced significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, particularly against conserved regions of HA, than egg-derived vaccines.  Evidence 3 and 4 from Liu et al. (2024) further elaborate on this, showing improved neutralizing antibody responses for A(H3N2) with RIV4.  However, these findings are not necessarily generalizable to *all* recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS or to all influenza subtypes.\n\n* **Subtypes and Limitations:**  Evidence 3 and 4 (Liu et al. 2024) highlight that the superiority of RIV4 is not consistent across all influenza subtypes (A(H1N1)pdm09 and B).  The impact of egg adaptation on antibody responses varied significantly between subtypes, suggesting that the claim's generality is overstated.  The studies show that while RIV4 excels with A(H3N2), the differences are less pronounced or even absent for other subtypes.\n\n* **Focus on Specific Antibodies:** The evidence primarily focuses on neutralizing antibodies and HA head binding antibodies. The claim is broader, mentioning \"broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA.\" While the studies demonstrate higher levels of *some* broadly cross-reactive antibodies, they don't comprehensively cover all such antibodies.\n\n* **Lack of Direct Comparison Across All BEVS-produced HA Antigens:** The evidence heavily relies on the RIV4 vaccine.  While RIV4 uses BEVS, the claim is about *all* recombinant HA antigens produced using this system.  The studies don't provide a broad comparison across all BEVS-produced HA antigens to definitively support the claim's generality.\n\n* **Evidence 5 and 6 (Treanor et al. 2011):** This evidence focuses on the immunogenicity and safety of rHA0 vaccines produced using BEVS, showing comparable antibody responses to egg-derived vaccines. This *contradicts* the claim of significantly *higher* antibody levels.  This further limits the generalizability of the claim.\n\n\nIn conclusion, while the evidence shows that *some* BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens (specifically within the RIV4 vaccine) induce higher levels of certain antibodies compared to egg-derived vaccines, particularly for A(H3N2), it does not support the claim's broad generalization to all such antigens and all influenza subtypes.  More comprehensive studies comparing a wider range of BEVS-produced HA antigens across various influenza subtypes are needed to fully support the claim.\n",

These /uniFB01 ndings are consistent with our previous report in which we found that among over 300 adults who received egg-based A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines with Q223R egg-adapted epitope during 5 in /uniFB02 uenza seasons, only 9% of participants mounted antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to 223R 38 ."

        "claim": "In medical literature, is it true that Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.?",
        "evaluation": "**SUPPORTED**\n\nThe claim that Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain versus 15 mcg per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine is supported by the provided evidence.\n\nEvidence 2 explicitly states that \"For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains\".  This directly confirms the 45 mcg per strain figure for Flublok.\n\nEvidence 7, a table from the CDC, further corroborates this, listing Flublok Quadrivalent as containing \"45 µg/0.5 mL\".  While it doesn't explicitly state \"per strain,\" given the trivalent nature of the vaccine (three strains) and the total HA amount, this implies 45 mcg per strain.\n\nEvidence 5 and 6 mention that quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (like Flublok) contain three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose egg-based vaccines.  Evidence 10 reinforces this, stating that standard-dose vaccines contain 15 µg of HA, while Flublok (RIV4) contains 45 µg.  This three-fold difference supports the claim indirectly but strongly.\n\nEvidence 3, while referring to an older formulation of Flublok, also shows a 45 mcg dose of HA per strain, further strengthening the overall support for the claim.  The difference in strains between this evidence and the more recent formulations is irrelevant to the core claim about the HA dosage per strain.\n\n\nTherefore, the multiple pieces of evidence consistently point towards Flublok containing 45 mcg of HA per strain, while standard-dose vaccines contain 15 mcg per strain.  The claim is thus strongly supported.\n",

Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein. Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection, USP.\n\n## 2.2. Clinical study design"

FluBlok induced serum antibody responses to all three components of the vaccine in the majority of recipients, although lower response rates were seen for the influenza B component. As expected, post vaccination geometric mean titers were substantially higher for all three components in FluBlok than in placebo recipients ( P &lt;.001 for all comparisons). The proportion of FluBlok recipients with a post-vaccination HAI titer of 1:40 or greater was 99% for the H1 component (95% CI, 97.1%, 99.5%), 97% for the H3 component (94.8%, 98.3%), and 96% for the B component (94.0%, 97.8%).\n\nAmong FluBlok recipients, subjects with a self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccine in the year prior to the study had higher baseline titers of antibody against all three components, and had significantly lower frequencies of HAI response than did those who reported that they had not received vaccine in the previous year. Subjects who reported prior vaccine receipt also had lower post vaccination GMTs for all three components than did those without this history, and this difference was statistically significant for both influenza A components.\n\n## 3.3.

ACIP  recommends  that  adults aged  ≥65  years  preferentially  receive  any  one  of  the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent  high-dose  inactivated  influenza  vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used. Higher dose vaccines include HD-IIV4 and RIV4, both of which contain a higher dose of HA antigen per virus than standard-dose vaccines (60 µ g for HD-IIV4 and 45 µ g for RIV4, compared with 15 µ g for standard-dose inactivated vaccines). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4) contains MF59 adjuvant.\n\n## Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2022-23"
