However, the evidence focuses solely on the *intended* composition of Flublok and does not provide data confirming the final product's complete fidelity to the target strains. Theoretical deviations during manufacturing, although unlikely given the described process, are not explicitly addressed.

      "explanation": "The provided evidence partially supports the claim but does not fully address all aspects. Evidence 1 and 2 confirm that Flublok contains recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, the key antigen for inducing an immune response against influenza.  However, neither piece of evidence states that Flublok contains *three times* the HA content of standard-dose vaccines. This core component of the claim lacks direct evidentiary support in the provided materials.  Evidence 3 demonstrates that Flublok induces a strong antibody response as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers. This supports the part of the claim stating that higher HA content is linked to greater immunogenicity, as the observed robust antibody response could potentially be attributed to a higher HA content.  However, without a direct comparison to a standard-dose vaccine group in the same study, it cannot be definitively concluded that Flublok's immunogenicity is *greater* than standard-dose vaccines.  Evidence 4 is irrelevant to the claim as it only states that Flublok cannot cause influenza and stimulates antibody production. Evidence 5 explores prior vaccine history and its impact on antibody response, but this does not inform the comparison between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines, nor does it address HA content.  A key limitation of the evidence is the absence of a direct comparison between Flublok and standard-dose vaccines in terms of both HA content and resulting immunogenicity within the same study.  Therefore, while the evidence suggests Flublok is immunogenic, the claim regarding the threefold HA content and superior immunogenicity compared to standard-dose vaccines remains unsubstantiated by the provided information."

Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines."

      "explanation": "The evidence strongly supports the claim that cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.  Evidence 1 and 4 explicitly state that adaptation of vaccine viruses in eggs or cell cultures can lead to mutations, specifically in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. These mutations can result in the vaccine inducing antibodies that are less effective against circulating wild-type viruses, as demonstrated by examples from various flu seasons (e.g., 2012-2013, 2014-2015). Evidence 3 further corroborates this by noting that egg-based vaccines have shown modest effectiveness, and new egg-free technologies are being developed to avoid glycosylation issues associated with egg adaptation that reduce effectiveness.  Evidence 5 acknowledges that while stringent quality control measures aim to minimize the risk of these mutations, the adaptation process itself can still introduce deleterious changes and impact vaccine availability.  Evidence 2, while highlighting the drawbacks of egg-based vaccine production, focuses primarily on logistical limitations and does not directly address the issue of mutations.  However, it implicitly supports the claim by mentioning the need for adaptation of vaccine viruses for egg production, a process that can lead to the selection of less representative strains, implying potential changes in the virus. While Evidence 5 mentions current stringent quality controls that aim to minimize mutation risks, it also acknowledges that the adaptation process itself can still introduce problems. Thus, the evidence collectively points to the potential for mutations during vaccine production as a legitimate concern, especially in egg-based methods, affecting vaccine effectiveness despite efforts to mitigate this risk."

This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched in /uniFB02 uenza strains 12,75 . The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza."

We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process-related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg-protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated.

The use of recombinant protein technology eliminates the risk of antigenic mismatch due to potential changes in primary HA structure through eggor cell-adaptation. We also describe features of the rHA tertiary structure that are likely to be responsible for the generation of broad cross-reactive and protective antibodies, together with the direct or indirect evidence supporting this. The homogeneity of rHA rosettes and negligible process-related impurities are the hallmarks of RIV4. As rHA production bypasses the need for a viral inactivation step and avoids the use of eggs, related process-impurities such as inactivating agents or residual egg-protein, and thus potential adverse reactions to these impurities in vulnerable individuals are eliminated. This wellestablished and validated platform for vaccine manufacture could be extended to address other emerging infectious diseases where cross-protection against constantly evolving variants is critical, such as pandemic in /uniFB02 uenza and/or COVID-19."

          "text": "Flublok [Influenza Vaccine] is a sterile, clear, colorless injection containing recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from three influenza viruses for intramuscular use. It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line ( expres SF+ ® ) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemicallydefined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes."

          "text": "The vaccine (FluBlok) used in this study consisted of purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as previously described [9]. The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg (as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay) of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza viruses recommended for the 2007-2008 influenza season formulated with 0.005% Tween ® -20 in 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 ± 0.4 without a preservative. Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein. Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection, USP."
