# Flublok Claims Verification Results

## Claim 1

**Flublok ensures identical antigenic match with WHO- and FDA-selected flu strains.**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 2

**Flublok contains 3x the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen content of standard-dose flu vaccines, which has been linked to greater immunogenicity vs standard-dose flu vaccines.**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 3

**Cell- and egg-based flu vaccines have the potential to develop mutations during production, which may reduce their effectiveness.**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 4

**Recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response that may provide cross-protection, even in a mismatch season.**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 5

**Vaccination with a higher-dose recombinant flu vaccine may induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines.**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 6

**Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated in the pivotal trial against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine).**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 7

**Flublok is produced using a novel production platform in which recombinant HA is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 8

**Recombinant HA antigens produced using BEVS have been shown to induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines.**

No supporting evidence found.

---

## Claim 9

**Flublok contains 45 micrograms (mcg) of HA per strain vs 15 mcg of HA per strain in a standard-dose influenza vaccine.**

No supporting evidence found.
