Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ' live ' in /uniFB02 uenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the G lobal Initiative on Sharing All In /uniFB02 uenza Data (GISAID) database and is con /uniFB01 rmed for /uniFB01 delity at the working virus bank level 28 . As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype in /uniFB02 uenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated."

Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 ."

In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

          "text": "As is  the  case  for  all  vaccines,  influenza  vaccines  contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications  to  their  use  a  history  of  previous  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For ccIIV4 and RIV4, a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for a history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, although rare,  can  occur  after  influenza  vaccination,  even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, identifying the causative component without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be  difficult.  Severe  allergic  reactions  after  vaccination  with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, some of which have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and which might represent a predisposition  to  development of allergic  manifestations  in affected persons ( 92-94 ). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions  can  occur,  ACIP  recommends  the  following  for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3):\n\n- â€¢  For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4:\n- 0 A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each individual  egg-based  IIV4  and  LAIV4  is  also contraindicated  for  persons  who  have  had  a  severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of  that  vaccine  (excluding  egg)  (see  Persons  with  a History of Egg Allergy).\n- â€¢  For ccIIV4:\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in  such  instances,  vaccination  should  occur  in  an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised  by  a  health  care  provider  who  is  able  to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction.\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4.\n- â€¢  For RIV4:\n- 0 A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution for the use of RIV4.

This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved.

The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza.\n\n## RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS"

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok Â® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\nÂ© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018 -19 ( N =723) and 2019 -20 ( N =684) in /uniFB02 uenza seasons. We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-eggbased vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immunememorytoegg-adaptedepitopesandre-focustheimmuneresponses towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.\n\nIn /uniFB02 uenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory infections in humans, annual in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination has been recommended in the United States (US) for many decades. Conventionally, in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine seed viruses are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs to produce inactivated in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines (IIV). However, this manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating in /uniFB02 uenza strains 1 -6 . Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that donot rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including\n\na cell culture-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent â„¢ by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flublok QuadrivalentÂ® by Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 Âµ g HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 Âµ g HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are currently licensed in the US . Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have 7 shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups 8 13 -.

Thus far, there are few direct comparisons of immunogenicity of the three vaccine platforms in populations with a history of frequent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccinations.

Those comparisons were focused on the neutralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses only. RIV4 elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses than IIV4 against cell-propagated vaccine viruses 27 . Repeat vaccination with ccIIV4 or RIV4 in 2 seasons also resulted in signi /uniFB01 cantly higher post-vaccination antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses 29 .

ILI was defined as having at least one symptom (no specified duration) in each of two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms. Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever &gt; 99Â°F ( &gt; 37Â°C) oral, chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reflex viral culture of rtPCRpositive samples."

Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0 pre-vaccination), 1-month, and 6-months post-vaccination. The Year 2 study was designed to evaluate the antibody responses following 7 different Year 1-Year 2 repeat vaccination regimens: IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0) and 1-month post-vaccination.\n\nFluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, the two egg-based vaccines were analyzed separately for this exploratory analysis because the two vaccines have different egg-adaptated mutation on the HA of the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV (Table 1). Fluzone has Q223R substitution which was associated with focused antibody response to 223R in some vaccinees as we previously reported 38 , while the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV in Fluarix had 223Q.

They explicitly state that Study 6 was a pivotal trial comparing Flublok Quadrivalent to Fluarix Quadrivalent in adults 50 years and older. Evidence 7 and 11 (Liu et al. (2024)) also support the claim, indicating a study comparing Flublok (RIV4) to Fluarix (IIV4), though this wasn't necessarily a pivotal trial. Other pieces of evidence are less relevant, focusing on vaccine composition, general efficacy data, or listing available influenza vaccines without detailing specific head-to-head comparisons in clinical trials. The Treanor et al. (2011) study examines FluBlok against a placebo, not Fluarix, thus doesn't address the claim.  The Hsiao et al. (2023) article highlights the need for data comparing recombinant and standard-dose vaccines but doesn't describe any specific head-to-head trials between Flublok and Fluarix. The CDC documents list both vaccines but do not provide information about head-to-head trials.",

It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line ( expres SF+ Â® ) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemicallydefined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.\n\nFlublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween Â® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( â‰¤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( â‰¤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( â‰¤ 100 mcg).\n\nFlublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives.

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , Â® Supemtek Â® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 Âµg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus."

These data warrant additional studies to verify whether rHA elicits a broader antibody repertoire than conventional vaccines and whether this underlies the cross-protection against antigenic drift variants previously observed in clinical trials 12,81 .\n\nRIV4 has a unique ability to induce broadly cross-reactive antibody responses to antigenically drifted A/H3N2 viruses in humans. In a small study by Belongia et al. 82 , participants aged 65 -74 years were immunised with RIV4, a high-dose split-virion inactivated trivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Fluzone Â® High Dose, Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur; HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted-IIV3 (aIIV3) 82 . Participant sera were tested against four A/H3N2 viruses including a cellpropagated reference vaccine strain, two circulating viruses and an antigenically advanced virus with evidence of antigenic drift. The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain ( p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that although the circulating A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically similar to the cell-grown vaccine reference virus, egg propagation of the vaccine strains had led to loss of a glycosylation site and"

However, for A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, the difference in HI antibody versus the total HA head binding antibody levels among 4 vaccine groups was less consistent, suggesting that the magnitude of improvement differ between subtypes and were likely determined by the relative immunodominance of the egg-adapted HA epitopes for each subtype. In addition, the egg/cell HA head binding ELISA titer ratios were around 1 for all vaccine antigen subtypes irrespective of vaccine platforms (Fig. 4B), suggesting the total HA binding antibody responses induced by vaccination cannot differentiate egg-adapted epitopes on HA even for A(H3N2). This is in stark contrast to the highly elevated egg/cell GMT ratio in neutralizing antibody responses to egg- vs cell-A(H3N2) viruses (Fig. 5A, B), highlighting the importance of inducing high quality, neutralizing antibody responses from vaccination.\n\nOur study also demonstrated that the impact of vaccine eggadaption may differ between in /uniFB02 uenza virus subtypes, with the biggest impact on neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) and moderate impact for in /uniFB02 uenza B vaccine viruses. HA changes due to egg-adaptation resulted in a loss of glycosylation at HA position 197 for both B/Victoria and B/ Yamagata egg vaccine viruses (Table 1), which could alter the antigenicity of in /uniFB02 uenza B virus, particularly for B/Victoria lineage 34 36 -.

Both Year 1 and Year 2 A(H1N1) pdm09vaccine viruses bear egg-adapted change at HA Q223R. Studies have reported that Q223R egg-adapted change at the HA head domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and in /uniFB02 uenceimmuneresponse 37 42 . In this study, 1-month -post-vaccination GMTs to both egg- and cell-propagated A(H1N1) pdm09 vaccine viruses in year 1 were similar among the 4 vaccine groups, with GMT egg/cell titer ratio around 1.0, and the proportion of HCPwithegg/cell titer ratio â‰¥ 4 was only 2 -11% (Fig. 5), indicating a less immunodominant role of Q223R change. Furthermore, the two egg IIV4 vaccines induced similar antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses regardless of the variation at 223. These /uniFB01 ndings are consistent with our previous report in which we found that among over 300 adults who received egg-based A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines with Q223R egg-adapted epitope during 5 in /uniFB02 uenza seasons, only 9% of participants mounted antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to 223R 38 ."
