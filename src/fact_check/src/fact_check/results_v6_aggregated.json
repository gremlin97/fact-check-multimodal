Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ' live ' in /uniFB02 uenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the G lobal Initiative on Sharing All In /uniFB02 uenza Data (GISAID) database and is con /uniFB01 rmed for /uniFB01 delity at the working virus bank level 28 . As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype in /uniFB02 uenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated.",

Compared to the cell-grown vaccine prototype viruses, the vaccine antigens from all 4 subtypes in the egg-based vaccines had HA substitutions due to egg-adaptation. A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV formulated in Fluzone IIV4 had Q223R substitution in both years, while the egg CVV used for Fluarix IIV4 and ccIIV4 in year 1 had G225A substitution instead (Table 1). For A(H3N2), year 1 egg-based vaccine had T160K (resulting in a loss of glycosylation motif at HA 158), L194P, and D225G egg-adapted changes, while year 2 egg-based vaccine had D190N and N246T substitutions. In /uniFB02 uenza B vaccine viruses remained the same in both years. Egg-based B/Victoria vaccine had T199I substitution, which can cause a loss of glycosylation motif at HA position 197; whereas egg-based B/Yamagata vaccine had a N197D substitution that can also cause a loss of glycosylation motif at HA position 197.",

Influenza  vaccination  is  the  primary 1 method for preventing influenza-related illnesses,   although  the  vaccine  effectiveness  ranges 2 from 20% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically  mismatched  to  the  circulating  viral strain to 40 to 60% in years in which the vaccine is antigenically well matched. 2,3 This large variation in effectiveness between years suggests that more effective vaccines are needed.\n\nIn traditional quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated  influenza  vaccines  (SD-IIV4),  chicken eggs  are  used  to  manufacture  the  influenza virus. Mutations in the hemagglutinin protein during egg-based manufacturing can result in mismatch between the selected strain and the vaccine strain.  The Flublok Quadrivalent influ4 enza  vaccine  (RIV4,  Sanofi)  is  manufactured without chicken eggs, resulting in a recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is genetically identical  to  that  in  the  selected  strain.   The  vaccine 5 also contains three times the amount of hemagglutinin  protein  as  standard-dose  vaccines,  an increased  level  that  has  been  correlated  with increased protective hemagglutinin antibodies. 6\n\nTo  estimate  the  relative  effectiveness  of  the recombinant vaccine as compared with standarddose  vaccines  against  laboratory-confirmed  influenza and influenza-related outcomes, we compared the two formulations of vaccines among members  of  the  Kaiser  Permanente  Northern California (KPNC) health care system who were between 18 and 64 years of age during the two influenza seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.",

Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.\n\nFlublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween ® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( ≤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( ≤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( ≤ 100 mcg).\n\nFlublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single-dose, prefilled syringes contain no natural rubber latex.",

The recombinant HA protein is not cleaved in insect cells and is referred to as rHA0. The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg (as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay) of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza viruses recommended for the 2007-2008 influenza season formulated with 0.005% Tween ® -20 in 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 ± 0.4 without a preservative. Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein. Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection, USP.\n\n## 2.2. Clinical study design",
