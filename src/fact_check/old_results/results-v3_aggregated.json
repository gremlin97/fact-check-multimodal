Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 .

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.",

Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults.",
