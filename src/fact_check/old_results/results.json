We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The evidence primarily focuses on Flublok's composition, manufacturing process, and some efficacy and immunogenicity data. While the evidence confirms Flublok contains HA proteins from specific influenza strains (presumably those selected by relevant authorities), it doesn't explicitly confirm these are *always* identical matches to *all* selected strains in a given year's vaccine formulation.  The provided marketing materials assert the match, but the Prescribing Information (PI), which is the most authoritative source, doesn't use the word \"ensure\" or guarantee a perfect match.  Evidence relating to Flublok Quadrivalent further complicates the analysis, as it's not necessarily directly applicable to Flublok Trivalent despite similar manufacturing processes. Some evidence even suggests potential antigenic mismatch (Evidence 16). Treanor et al.

Furthermore, efficacy against circulating strains varied in the studies, highlighting the complex relationship between HA content, antibody response, and real-world protection.

        "raw_explanation": "[General Analysis]\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the part of the claim regarding Flublok containing 3x the HA antigen of standard-dose flu vaccines.  Multiple sources confirm Flublok contains 45 mcg of HA per strain, while standard doses contain 15 mcg. The evidence relating to increased immunogenicity is more nuanced. While the marketing material and some evidence suggest a link between higher HA content and greater immunogenicity, the evidence primarily focuses on antibody response, which is a marker but not the sole determinant of immunogenicity.  Furthermore, efficacy against circulating strains varied in the studies, highlighting the complex relationship between HA content, antibody response, and real-world protection. The evidence also touches on the recombinant nature of Flublok and its potential advantages, but these are not the primary focus of the claim.\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\n\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Clearly states Flublok contains 45 mcg HA per strain, directly supporting the 3x antigen claim.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 1.  Clearly states Flublok contains 45 mcg HA per strain.\n\nEvidence 3:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Only mentions the section heading \"Clinical Pharmacology,\" providing no relevant information.\n\nEvidence 4:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Explains Flublok's mechanism of action involving HA proteins as antigens, indirectly relating to the immunogenicity aspect, but doesn't directly compare it to standard-dose vaccines.  Discusses antigenic drift, highlighting the challenges of vaccine effectiveness regardless of HA content.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses the relevance of quadrivalent Flublok data to trivalent Flublok, but doesn't address the claim's components.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 5. Discusses data relevance based on manufacturing process, not HA content or immunogenicity.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses nonclinical toxicology studies, which are irrelevant to the claim.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Duplicate of Evidence 7, just a section heading.\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  A combination of Evidence 4's content and Evidence 8. Irrelevant overall to the core of the claim.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Discusses the benefits of recombinant technology and references previous studies on rHA0 vaccines showing tolerability and immunogenicity, indirectly supporting the claim.

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ' live ' in /uniFB02 uenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the G lobal Initiative on Sharing All In /uniFB02 uenza Data (GISAID) database and is con /uniFB01 rmed for /uniFB01 delity at the working virus bank level 28 . As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype in /uniFB02 uenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated."

          "text": "## POTENTIAL ANTIGENIC MISMATCH OF INFLUENZA VACCINE VIRUS GROWN IN EGG OR CELLS DUE TO ADAPTIVE MUTATIONS IN THE HA PRIMARY STRUCTURE\n\nA known risk of traditional split or subunit vaccines is the potential for the candidate vaccine virus or working virus seeds to acquire adaptive mutations as they grow in embryonated chicken egg or mammalian host cells during vaccine manufacture. Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 ."

As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production.

The /uniFB01 rst candidate recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist, Salmonella typhimurium /uniFB02 agellin type 2 29 . The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models 29 . In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability 30 . The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puri /uniFB01 ed HA protein) using a minimal number of bioreactors 31 . The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility 31 . This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32 . However, E. coli -expressed rHA proteins can be subject to misfolding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation 33 . They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31 . The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31 . These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of E. coli -expressed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.\n\nFlublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween ® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( ≤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( ≤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( ≤ 100 mcg).\n\nFlublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives. The single-dose, prefilled syringes contain no natural rubber latex."

Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 ."

Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization.

          "text": "## RECOMBINANT HA EXPRESSION SYSTEMS\n\nBoth prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been used for the manufacture of rHA vaccine antigens. The /uniFB01 rst candidate recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist, Salmonella typhimurium /uniFB02 agellin type 2 29 . The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models 29 . In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability 30 . The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puri /uniFB01 ed HA protein) using a minimal number of bioreactors 31 . The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility 31 . This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32 . However, E. coli -expressed rHA proteins can be subject to misfolding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation 33 . They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31 . The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31 . These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of E. coli -expressed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines."

        "general_analysis": "The evidence presents a mixed picture regarding the claim that recombinant technology leads to a broader immune response and cross-protection in a mismatch season. Some evidence strongly supports the claim by highlighting the mechanism of recombinant vaccine production that avoids mutations associated with egg-based methods and allows for targeting conserved regions of the HA protein, promoting broader antibody responses.  Clinical trials mentioned in the evidence show a degree of cross-protection with Flublok, even during mismatch seasons.  However, other evidence focuses solely on the composition and production of Flublok without directly addressing cross-protection or broader immune responses. Several pieces of evidence are irrelevant to the claim, discussing unrelated aspects of the vaccine such as toxicology or geriatric use. Importantly, while a broader immune response is suggested, the degree and clinical significance of this cross-protection remains unclear based on the provided evidence.",

Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8].

          "text": "Although embryonated hen's eggs have been used to generate effective influenza vaccines for many years, this system does have several important drawbacks. Vaccine manufacturing using eggs requires specialized facilities, and the ability to scale up egg production rapidly in response to an emergency is limited. In addition, poultryarepotentiallyvulnerabletothesamesubtypesofinfluenza\n\nviruses that might also be responsible for pandemic influenza. It is usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high yield growth in eggs, a process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and which can select receptor variants that may not be optimally representative of circulating influenza strains [1,2].\n\nExpression of proteins in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus has emerged as a promising technology for vaccine production. New recombinant baculoviruses can be generated quickly from sequence data, protein expression is very efficient under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, and post translational modifications of the protein are generally similar to other eukaryotic systems. In previous studies, we have evaluated baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinins (rHA0s) as influenza vaccines in humans. Monovalent and bivalent rHA0s have been well tolerated and immunogenic in\n\nyoung adults and adults 65 and older [3-5]. More recent studies have evaluated rHA0 vaccine formulations in healthy adults, subjects aged 50-64 years of age [6] and subjects 65 and older [7,8]. These studies have consistently shown excellent tolerability and antibody responses similar to those seen with egg-derived influenza vaccines. Finally, in a preliminary field efficacy evaluation, recipients of the rHA0 vaccine had reduced rates of culture-positive CDC-defined influenza-like illness compared with placebo recipients, although the study was small [9].\n\nIn the present study, we performed a much larger assessment of the immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy of the final formulation of trivalent rHA0 vaccine in a population of healthy young adults.\n\n## 2.

        "general_analysis": "The provided evidence offers mixed support for the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The marketing materials for Flublok repeatedly emphasize the higher antigen content (3x) compared to standard doses, suggesting a link to greater immunogenicity. Evidence from the Flublok Prescribing Information (PI) details the recombinant HA production process and dosage but doesn't directly compare its antibody response to egg-based vaccines. Treanor et al. (2011) provide evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant vaccine but primarily focus on efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza, not a direct comparison of antibody responses.  Crucially, Hsiao et al. (2023) provide the strongest support for the claim, showing that a high-dose recombinant vaccine offered more protection against PCR-confirmed influenza in adults aged 50-64 than a standard-dose vaccine.  However, this study does not directly compare antibody levels, but rather clinical outcomes.  Therefore, while suggestive, it does not definitively prove a more robust *antibody* response.",

        "raw_explanation": "[General Analysis]\n\nThe provided evidence offers mixed support for the claim that higher-dose recombinant flu vaccines induce a more robust antibody response than egg-based standard-dose vaccines. The marketing materials for Flublok repeatedly emphasize the higher antigen content (3x) compared to standard doses, suggesting a link to greater immunogenicity. Evidence from the Flublok Prescribing Information (PI) details the recombinant HA production process and dosage but doesn't directly compare its antibody response to egg-based vaccines. Treanor et al. (2011) provide evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant vaccine but primarily focus on efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza, not a direct comparison of antibody responses.  Crucially, Hsiao et al. (2023) provide the strongest support for the claim, showing that a high-dose recombinant vaccine offered more protection against PCR-confirmed influenza in adults aged 50-64 than a standard-dose vaccine.  However, this study does not directly compare antibody levels, but rather clinical outcomes.  Therefore, while suggestive, it does not definitively prove a more robust *antibody* response.\n\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Describes Flublok's composition and confirms it is a recombinant vaccine with a specific HA content (45 mcg per strain), which is higher than the standard dose (15 mcg). This partially supports the idea of a higher dose, but doesn't address antibody response.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 1.\n\nEvidence 3:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Simply introduces the section on the mechanism of action but provides no information relevant to the claim.\n\nEvidence 4:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses a study on Flublok Quadrivalent, noting insufficient data to compare elderly and younger subject responses, but doesn't directly address antibody response or comparison to egg-based vaccines.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 4.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Explains that Flublok induces a humoral immune response measured by HI antibody.  This is relevant to the concept of an antibody response but doesn't compare it to egg-based vaccines.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Discusses the advantages of recombinant technology and mentions previous studies showing good tolerability and antibody responses \"similar\" to egg-derived vaccines.  This doesn't support a *more robust* response, but lays the groundwork for the possibility.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Describes a study showing FluBlok was effective in preventing influenza. This study showed HAI antibody responses, but did not directly compare the magnitude of response to egg-based vaccines.  The focus on efficacy rather than specific antibody levels makes it only partially relevant.\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Introduces a section on nonclinical toxicology and is irrelevant to the claim.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Discusses lack of carcinogenic or mutagenic potential testing. Irrelevant.\n\nEvidence 11:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Explicitly states that recombinant vaccines contain three times the hemagglutinin protein and aren't susceptible to antigenic drift, implicitly supporting the premise of a potential for stronger response.  However, it calls for more data comparing effectiveness.\n\nEvidence 12:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 6.\n\nEvidence 13:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Provides the strongest evidence by showing better *protection* with the high-dose recombinant vaccine.  However, this is a clinical outcome, not a direct measure of antibody response.\n\nEvidence 14:\n- Relevancy Score: 5/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 13.\n\nEvidence 15:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Lists references to studies, some of which assess Flublok's safety and immunogenicity. These studies could contain relevant information, but their conclusions are not directly presented here.\n\nEvidence 16:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This extract describes the drawbacks of egg-based vaccines and lays out the rationale for exploring recombinant technology. While it doesn't directly support the claim about antibody response, it provides context as to *why* a recombinant vaccine *might* be superior.\n\n\nEvidence 17:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Similar to Evidence 8, describes a study demonstrating the efficacy of FluBlok. While it mentions antibody responses being observed, it doesn't provide a direct comparison with egg-based vaccines in terms of antibody levels.\n\nEvidence 18:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Simply article information; irrelevant.\n\nEvidence 19:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  Introduces the methods section of a paper, but doesn't provide information directly relevant to the claim.\n\n\nEvidence 20:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 15."

These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody).\n\nAntibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

        "raw_explanation": "[General Analysis]\n\nThe claim states that Flublok (quadrivalent) was evaluated against Fluarix (quadrivalent standard-dose vaccine) in the pivotal trial.  The provided evidence strongly supports this claim, specifically citing Study 6 within the Flublok Prescribing Information (FlublokPI.pdf). This study directly compares Flublok Quadrivalent to Fluarix Quadrivalent in a randomized, controlled trial.  While other evidence describes the composition and other studies of Flublok (including the trivalent version), they are less relevant to the specific comparison mentioned in the claim.  It is important to note that while the evidence supports the claim regarding the *comparison* having taken place, it does not state whether this specific study was the *pivotal* trial that led to Flublok's approval.  The supplied text does not define which trial was considered pivotal.\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\n\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Describes the composition of Flublok, not its comparison to Fluarix in a trial.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Duplicate of Evidence 1.

Such adaptive mutations in HA peptides may reduce the effectiveness of the resultant vaccine 24 26 -. Raymond et al. 24 showed that an eggadapted A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain acquired a mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 226 which in turn induced antibodies speci /uniFB01 c to receptor binding site that bound to vaccine-derived HA preferentially over the circulating wild-type virus 24 . During the 2012 -2013 northern hemisphere in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination campaign, HA from an egg-adapted A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus used for vaccine manufacturing differed from the WHO-recommended prototype and several other wild-type in /uniFB02 uenza viruses in three positions, H156Q, G186V, and S219Y 25 . The low vaccine effectiveness (41%) observed for H3N2 in the 2012 -2013 season was attributed to these three mutations during vaccine production 25 . Other antigenic mutations introduced by egg-adaptation of the vaccine strain during vaccine manufacturing are thought to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness estimates for H3N2 in other in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 26,27 ."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Influenza B viruses isolated in this study and elsewhere in North America during the 2007-2008 season belonged to the Yamagata lineage of influenza B viruses, against which vaccines representing the Victoria lineage would be expected to have little or no efficacy. We also found that the efficacy of FluBlok against CDC-ILI associated with influenza B was substantially lower than that against influenza A."

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus."

Two recently published studies have evaluated egg-grown inactivated vaccines in healthy adults using a placebo-controlled design during the 2007-2008 influenza season. In one study, conducted primarily in Europe, the overall efficacy of egg-grown inactivated vaccine against culture confirmedillness was 63%, and the lower 95% CI was 46.7% [18]. The predominant influenza A isolates in that study were H1N1 viruses, which were mostly vaccine-like. In another smaller study done on college campuses in Michigan [19], the protective efficacy of TIV against culture confirmed illness was 73% (95% CI, 51%, 85%). In that study, 90% of influenza isolates were influenza A (H3N2), but the antigenic characterization of isolates was not reported. In other recent randomized trials, the protective efficacy of TIV was 22.3% in the 2005-2006 influenza season predominated by influenza B viruses and with overall low attack rates [20], and 49.3% over two seasons, 2005-2007 with most cases due to antigenically variant viruses [21].\n\nBecause of the difficulty in conducting placebo-controlled studies of influenza vaccine especially as the target groups for vaccination have expanded, several recent assessments of influenza vaccine effectiveness have utilized a test-negative, case-control design. Estimates of overall inactivated vaccine protective effectiveness in these studies have ranged from 10% to 70% [22-25] and\n\nare clearly impacted by antigenic differences between vaccine and circulating viruses, with highest levels of effectiveness reported for H1 viruses [25] and lowest levels for influenza B.\n\nThe current study provides evidence of protective efficacy of a baculovirus-derived HA vaccine in adults for prevention of seasonal influenza and supports that significant protection in a primed population can be obtained against influenza with a pure hemagglutinin vaccine. The efficacy results also demonstrate that in adults, the minor differences in HA glycosylation seen in insect cells compared to mammalian cells and the synthesis of the HA as an uncleaved precursor do not preclude the generation of an effective immune response in adults.\n\nThe use of recombinant DNA techniques to express proteins in cell culture has been a successful approach for generation of highly effective vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) andhumanpapillomavirus(HPV),andbaculovirusexpressiontechnology is currently used for a licensed HPV vaccine [26]. Among the available expression technologies, recombinant baculovirus is especially well suited for production of influenza vaccine because the rapidity with which genes can be cloned and inserted into this vector facilitates updating the vaccine at regular intervals. Expression of the HA protein in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus also avoids the need to work with potentially pathogenic, live influenza viruses, and the attendant biocontainment issues that would be a particular concern for production of pandemic vaccines [27]. The results of the current study support the utility of insect cells for the production of well tolerated and effective vaccines for seasonal influenza."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance.

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines."

The /uniFB01 rst candidate recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines to be successfully manufactured using an Escherichia coli fermentation system involved expression of the globular head domain of the HA protein genetically fused with the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist, Salmonella typhimurium /uniFB02 agellin type 2 29 . The resultant vaccines elicited strong and protective antibody responses in mouse models 29 . In Phase 1 clinical evaluation, a prototypic quadrivalent vaccine developed using this E. coli platform elicited immune responses in healthy adults with favourable tolerability 30 . The E. coli expression system has been shown to generate a high yields of rHA (200 mg/L of puri /uniFB01 ed HA protein) using a minimal number of bioreactors 31 . The authors projected that the strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility 31 . This approach will likely shorten the entire vaccine manufacturing process 32 . However, E. coli -expressed rHA proteins can be subject to misfolding, contain impurities (e.g., host-cell proteins), and do not undergo glycosylation 33 . They therefore need extensive processing to attain desired purity and to fold to their native conformation 31 . The resulting processed proteins are less immunogenic than egg-derived antigens, with around a 10-fold greater quantity needed to generate protective immunity in animal models 31 . These inherent complications have prevented large scale manufacturing and eventual commercialisation of E. coli -expressed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production.

        "raw_explanation": "[General Analysis]\nThe claim asserts that BEVS-produced recombinant HA antigens induce significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against highly conserved regions of HA compared with egg-derived vaccines. The evidence primarily focuses on the disadvantages of egg-based vaccine production, such as the potential for adaptive mutations and antigenic mismatch, and the advantages of recombinant technologies like BEVS in avoiding these issues.  While several pieces of evidence highlight the fidelity of BEVS-produced HA to the wild-type virus, the claim of *significantly higher levels of broadly cross-reactive antibodies* is only partially supported.  Some evidence suggests that BEVS-produced vaccines induce comparable antibody responses to egg-based vaccines, while other evidence hints at broader cross-reactivity but doesn't always directly compare antibody levels. More evidence explicitly comparing antibody levels between BEVS and egg-derived vaccines is needed to fully support the claim.\n\n\n[Evidence Assessments]\nEvidence 1:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This evidence details the potential for adaptive mutations in egg-based vaccines, indirectly supporting the advantage of BEVS in avoiding this problem. However, it doesn't directly compare antibody levels between the two methods.\n\nEvidence 2:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Mentions the drawbacks of egg-based systems and the potential of BEVS, but focuses on tolerability and antibody responses *similar* to egg-derived vaccines, not *significantly higher*.\n\nEvidence 3:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This evidence describes the BEVS production process of Flublok and its advantages over traditional egg-based methods. It does not explicitly compare the antibody levels.\n\nEvidence 4:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This is just a title repetition and doesn't provide relevant information to the claim.\n\nEvidence 5:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning:  This evidence provides results from a study showing the efficacy of a trivalent rHA0 vaccine (FluBlok) but focuses primarily on overall efficacy and not directly on comparing antibody levels against conserved HA regions compared to egg-based vaccines.\n\nEvidence 6:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This evidence discusses the problems with egg-adaptation and how it leads to lower effectiveness, particularly with H3N2.  It mentions that rHA (like that in Flublok) performs better in specific cases of glycosylation mismatch, suggesting potentially better cross-reactivity, but doesn't explicitly compare overall antibody levels.\n\nEvidence 7:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning:  Similar to Evidence 2, it primarily discusses the drawbacks of egg-based vaccines and potential of BEVS, but notes similar, not significantly higher, antibody responses in previous studies.\n\nEvidence 8:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This is a section heading and is not relevant to the claim.\n\nEvidence 9:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This mentions that RIV4 (Flublok) induces higher magnitudes of hemagglutination inhibitory antibody response against HA1 compared to egg- or cell-derived split vaccines. This suggests broader antibody response, but doesn't necessarily mean against conserved HA regions as specified in the claim.  Further, it mentions the need for more studies verifying broader antibody repertoire and cross-protection.\n\nEvidence 10:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This evidence discusses alternative expression systems (E. coli) and their drawbacks, which is not directly relevant to comparing BEVS and egg-based vaccines.\n\nEvidence 11:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This section discusses plant-derived rHA, a different production method, which isn't relevant for the direct comparison asked for in the claim.\n\nEvidence 12:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Explains the mechanism of Flublok and how it induces a humoral immune response, but doesn't compare antibody levels to egg-based vaccines.\n\nEvidence 13:\n- Relevancy Score: 2/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: This is a description of Flublok's composition and doesn't provide any comparative data on antibody responses.\n\nEvidence 14:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning:  This is just a description of Flublok's composition and manufacturing, providing no comparative data related to the claim.\n\n\nEvidence 15:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Similar to Evidence 5, it provides results from a study but focuses on general efficacy and not the specific comparison of antibody levels against conserved HA regions between BEVS and egg-derived vaccines.\n\nEvidence 16:\n- Relevancy Score: 1/5\n- Assessment: Not applicable\n- Reasoning: Just a section heading; not relevant to the claim.\n\nEvidence 17:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Highlights how recombinant technology avoids egg-adapted mutations, indirectly supporting its advantages, but doesn't compare resulting antibody levels.\n\nEvidence 18:\n- Relevancy Score: 4/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: Similar to Evidence 17, it emphasizes the avoidance of mutations in recombinant technologies.\n\nEvidence 19:\n- Relevancy Score: 3/5\n- Assessment: Partially Agrees\n- Reasoning: This section discusses the safety advantages of RIV4 due to the lack of egg proteins and other impurities.

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 8963 healthy, medically stable adults (mean age 62.5 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Flublok Quadrivalent (n=4474) or a U.S.-licensed quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Comparator, Fluarix Quadrivalent, manufactured by Glaxo SmithKline) (n=4489).\n\nAmong randomized subjects, 58% were female, 80% white, 18% black/African-American, 2% other races, and 5% of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. A total of 5186 (60%) subjects were 50-64 years of age and 3486 (40%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) -confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post- vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 6 months post- vaccination. ILI was defined as having at least one symptom (no specified duration) in each of two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms. Respiratory symptoms included sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Systemic symptoms included fever &gt; 99°F ( &gt; 37°C) oral, chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia. For subjects with an episode of ILI, a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for rtPCR testing and reflex viral culture of rtPCRpositive samples."

The trivalent vaccine contained 45 mcg (as measured by the single radial immunodiffusion assay) of each purified rHA0 derived from the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza viruses recommended for the 2007-2008 influenza season formulated with 0.005% Tween ® -20 in 10mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 ± 0.4 without a preservative. Genes were cloned into baculovirus using RT-PCR from the same CDCderived vaccine seed viruses used for the production of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for that year. Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified monovalent materials indicated that hemagglutinin constitutes at least 90% of the total protein.

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
