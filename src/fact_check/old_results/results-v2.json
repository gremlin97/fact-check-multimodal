The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , ® Supemtek ® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 µg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus."

We conducted this study to determine the protective efficacy a recombinant, baculovirus-expressed seasonal trivalent influenza virus hemagglutinin (rHA0) vaccine (FluBlok ® ).\n\nMethods: Healthy adult subjects at 24 centers across the US were randomly assigned to receive a single injectionofsalineplacebo(2304subjects),ortrivalentFluBlokcontaining45mcgofeachrHA0component (2344 subjects). Serum samples for assessment of immune responses by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) were taken from a subset of subjects before and 28 days after immunization. Subjects were followed during the 2007-2008 influenza season and combined nasal and throat swabs for virus isolation were obtained from subjects reporting influenza-like illness.\n\nResults: Rates of local and systemic side effects were low, and the rates of systemic side effects were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. HAI antibody responses were seen in 78%, 81%, and 52% of FluBlok recipients to the H1, H3, and B components, respectively. FluBlok was 44.6% (95% CI, 18.8%, 62.6%) effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza meeting the CDC influenza-like illness case definition despite significant antigenic mismatch between the vaccine antigens and circulating viruses. Conclusions: Trivalent rHA0 vaccine was safe, immunogenic and effective in the prevention of culture confirmed influenza illness, including protection against drift variants.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
