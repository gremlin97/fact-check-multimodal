Differences in HA glycosylation between the vaccine strains and circulating strains are thought to have contributed to this reduced vaccine effectiveness 26 . During the 2014 2015 in -/uniFB02 uenza season, a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain possessing a new predicted HA glycosylation site emerged 26 . For the 2016 2017 season, the in -/uniFB02 uenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain (A/Colorado/15/2014) containing the new glycosylation site 26 . However, this particular glycosylation site was absent in the egg-adapted virus. Consequently, antibodies induced in humans, and in ferrets, poorly neutralised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 strain 26 . Contrary to the eggderived vaccines and as expected, rHA containing the new glycosylation site induced optimal levels of antibodies that ef /uniFB01 ciently recognised the glycosylated clade 3 C.2a H3N2 virus 26 . The chances of introducing deleterious mutations through the adaptation of seed virus during vaccine manufacturing today are low due to the stringent quality control of the working seed virus. Indeed, as per current regulatory requirements, seed viruses must be con /uniFB01 rmed for both genetic and antigenic match with their originating wild-type virus before they can be used for vaccine production. Nonetheless, the time it takes to generate appropriate seeds could hinder the timely availability of the vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology avoids the risk of the virus acquiring egg- or cell-adapted mutations during the manufacturing process as it does not use ' live ' in /uniFB02 uenza virus. Instead, DNA coding for HA is cloned from a reference virus published in the G lobal Initiative on Sharing All In /uniFB02 uenza Data (GISAID) database and is con /uniFB01 rmed for /uniFB01 delity at the working virus bank level 28 . As such, the primary amino-acid sequence of the rHA produced using baculovirus or other recombinant expression system is identical to the HA from the wild-type virus isolate selected for seasonal in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine production. Thus, the risk of antigenic mismatch of RIV4, or other rHA vaccines in development, with the wildtype in /uniFB02 uenza strain selected for vaccines is eliminated.",

This unique characteristic of the recombinant vaccine is likely related to glycosylation of rHA in the insect cell line, leaving it uncleaved. The higher quantity and greater accessibility of the genetically conserved stem region of rHA produced in insect cells (resulting in smaller N-linked glycans) may contribute to cross-protection against mismatched in /uniFB02 uenza strains 12,75 . The study by Nachbagaeur et al. 78 supports the hypothesis that a recombinant vaccine results in increased titre of broadly neutralising HA stemreactive antibodies and that these immune responses increase with age 78 . This increase with age is possibly due to repeated exposure to divergent in /uniFB02 uenza viruses similar to the multiple A/ H3N2 virus strains evaluated by Belongia et al. 82 . Therefore, vaccine constructs that preserve the highly conserved HA stem can protect against drifted viruses and thus may confer a greater breadth of protection against in /uniFB02 uenza.\n\n## RECOMBINANT HA ANTIGENS ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO CHEMICAL MODIFICATIONS",

          "text": "Repeat vaccination with egg-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines could preferentially boost antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes and reduce immunogenicity to circulating viruses. In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018 -19 ( N =723) and 2019 -20 ( N =684) in /uniFB02 uenza seasons. We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HAheadbinding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-eggbased vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immunememorytoegg-adaptedepitopesandre-focustheimmuneresponses towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.\n\nIn /uniFB02 uenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory infections in humans, annual in /uniFB02 uenza vaccination has been recommended in the United States (US) for many decades. Conventionally, in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine seed viruses are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs to produce inactivated in /uniFB02 uenza vaccines (IIV). However, this manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating in /uniFB02 uenza strains 1 -6 . Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that donot rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including\n\na cell culture-based in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent â„¢ by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (Flublok QuadrivalentÂ® by Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 Âµ g HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 Âµ g HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are currently licensed in the US . Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have 7 shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups 8 13 -. Observational studies and clinical trials reported that ccIIV and RIV demonstrated modest to signi /uniFB01 cant improvement of VE over egg-based IIV in different age groups and in /uniFB02 uenza seasons 7,14 -16 .\n\nWepreviously reported that antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines . The potential of non-egg-based vaccines to miti3 gate the impact of prior egg-based vaccination remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed neutralizing antibody responses to both egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses, and total binding antibodies to both HAheadandHAstalkamongHCPfollowing vaccination with RIV, ccIIV, and standard egg-based IIVs in two in /uniFB02 uenza seasons to investigate whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines can overcome the effect of prior repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines.",

It contains purified HA proteins produced in a continuous insect cell line ( expres SF+ Â® ) that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (which is related to moths, caterpillars and butterflies), and grown in serum-free medium composed of chemicallydefined lipids, vitamins, amino acids, and mineral salts. Each of the three HAs is expressed in this cell line using a baculovirus vector ( Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), extracted from the cells with Triton X-100 and further purified by column chromatography. The purified HAs are then blended and filled into single-dose syringes.\n\nFlublok is standardized according to United States Public Health Service (USPHS) requirements. For the 2024-2025 influenza season it is formulated to contain 135 mcg HA per 0.5 mL dose, with 45 mcg HA of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/West Virginia/30/2022 (A/Wisconsin/67/2022 pdm09-like virus) (H1N1), A/Massachusetts/18/ 2022 (H3N2) and B/Austria/1359417/2021.\n\nA single 0.5 mL dose of Flublok contains sodium chloride (4.4 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (0.2 mg), dibasic sodium phosphate (0.5 mg), and polysorbate 20 (Tween Â® 20) (27.5 mcg). Each 0.5 mL dose of Flublok may also contain residual amounts of baculovirus and Spodoptera frugiperda cell proteins ( â‰¤ 14.3 mcg), baculovirus and cellular DNA ( â‰¤ 10 ng), and Triton X-100 ( â‰¤ 100 mcg).\n\nFlublok contains no egg proteins, antibiotics, or preservatives.

The adoption of alternative vaccine development approaches (including mRNA, vector, and recombinant protein strategies) in the urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of using more ef /uniFB01 cient methods to produce new, effective vaccines within accelerated development timelines. The recombinant quadrivalent in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine (RIV4, Flublok , Â® Supemtek Â® [EU, Canada], Sano /uniFB01 Pasteur) was the /uniFB01 rst licensed in /uniFB02 uenza vaccine to be produced using recombinant viral proteins instead of antigens derived from live in /uniFB02 uenza virus (as for inactivated split-virion and subunit vaccines). RIV4 is an unadjuvanted vaccine containing 45 Âµg of HA/dose from each of the four strains. The production of RIV4 is based on a novel production platform in which recombinant HA (rHA) is expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) 22 . In brief, expres SF + insect cells are infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the relevant in /uniFB02 uenza HA genes, which are expressed under the control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promotor. rHA molecules from the infected cells are extracted using detergent and puri /uniFB01 ed from the clari /uniFB01 ed cell extract using column chromatographies followed by Q membrane /uniFB01 ltration. Puri /uniFB01 ed rHA is suspended in relevant buffer using tangential /uniFB02 ow /uniFB01 ltration and passed through sterile /uniFB01 ltration for storage and formulation 22 . RIV4 has undergone extensive clinical assessment 23 , and was /uniFB01 rst approved by FDA in 2013. It is now licensed in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and various other countries.\n\nThis review focuses on the structural features of BEVS-derived rHA that make RIV4 unique from conventional vaccines, and how these features help to maximise vaccine performance. Notably, the bene /uniFB01 ts of this manufacturing process can be extended to other viral targets, such as COVID-19, where the preservation of conserved epitopes is critical for imparting cross-protection against a constantly evolving and mutating virus.",

RIV4 also induces antibodies, in both humans and mice, that are speci /uniFB01 c to epitopes in the HA head region, at greater proportions than a traditional mammalian cell-derived subunit vaccine (Flucelvax Â® [Trivalent]) 77 .

The post-vaccination geometric mean fold rise against the two circulating viruses was twice as high for RIV4 as for HD-IIV3 or aIIV3. Post-vaccination titre against the antigenically drifted H3N2 were generally low and similar across all groups, however, receipt of RIV4 was strongly associated with seroconversion to this strain ( p = 0.003).

However, for A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, the difference in HI antibody versus the total HA head binding antibody levels among 4 vaccine groups was less consistent, suggesting that the magnitude of improvement differ between subtypes and were likely determined by the relative immunodominance of the egg-adapted HA epitopes for each subtype. In addition, the egg/cell HA head binding ELISA titer ratios were around 1 for all vaccine antigen subtypes irrespective of vaccine platforms (Fig. 4B), suggesting the total HA binding antibody responses induced by vaccination cannot differentiate egg-adapted epitopes on HA even for A(H3N2). This is in stark contrast to the highly elevated egg/cell GMT ratio in neutralizing antibody responses to egg- vs cell-A(H3N2) viruses (Fig. 5A, B), highlighting the importance of inducing high quality, neutralizing antibody responses from vaccination.\n\nOur study also demonstrated that the impact of vaccine eggadaption may differ between in /uniFB02 uenza virus subtypes, with the biggest impact on neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) and moderate impact for in /uniFB02 uenza B vaccine viruses. HA changes due to egg-adaptation resulted in a loss of glycosylation at HA position 197 for both B/Victoria and B/ Yamagata egg vaccine viruses (Table 1), which could alter the antigenicity of in /uniFB02 uenza B virus, particularly for B/Victoria lineage 34 36 -.
